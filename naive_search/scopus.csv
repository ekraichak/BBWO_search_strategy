However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding of bobcat (Lynx rufus) habitat selection in longleaf pine savannas and research is warranted to direct our future management decisions. Methods: We examined bobcat habitat selection in a pine savanna managed with frequent fires at two spatial scales (i.e., study area boundary [hereafter, landscape scale]) and annual area of use [95% kernel density; local scale]), and assessed effects of prescribed fire on bobcat habitat selection. Specifically, we monitored 45 bobcats (16 males and 29 females) during 2001–2007. Results: We found differential habitat selection by sex. At the landscape scale, female bobcats were closer to mixed pine-hardwoods, young pine, and secondary roads, but farther from mature pine and hardwoods stands relative to males. We found no difference in selection of agriculture, shrub-scrub, and primary roads between sexes. At the annual area of use scale, female bobcats were closer to secondary roads, but farther from agriculture and shrub-scrub relative to males. We found no difference in selection of mature pine, mixed pine-hardwoods, hardwoods, young pine, and primary roads between sexes. Bobcats primarily selected for stands burned ≤ 1.1 years post-fire. Conclusions: Our results show that bobcats exploit a broad range of habitat types in pine landscapes managed with frequent fire and commonly use recently burned stands (≤ 1.1 year post-fire), suggesting prey in many areas of this system are at risk of bobcat predation. Additionally, we suggest land managers consider scale of selection by bobcats when developing habitat management strategies. © 2018, The Author(s).","Georgia; Habitat selection; Lynx rufus; Pinus palustris; Prescribed fire",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046655064

Forest habitat structures, such as large trees, dead trees and logs are highly flammable, yet also are essential for animal species that require hollows (cavities) as den sites for shelter and reproduction. We examined the effects of experimental prescribed burns on the use of den sites by a small marsupial, the yellow-footed antechinus Antechinus flavipes, in south-eastern Australia. Specifically, we radio-tracked individual A. flavipes to identify forest habitat structures preferred as den sites and recorded the fate of known den sites following patchy prescribed burns. We found that large living trees and dead trees were used as den sites disproportionately to their relative abundance in the forest. While all marked individuals of A. flavipes survived the immediate impacts of patchy prescribed burns, almost a third (16/52) of den sites identified before burning were lost, including 17% of trees (4/23) and 48% of logs (10/21). The vulnerability of den sites to prescribed burns can be attributed to the decay-dependent effect of fire on both trees and logs, whereby, the amount of damage from fire is related to the structure's pre-fire condition (i.e. whether dead or alive, amount of decay). Large trees and large logs are scarce in this dry forest ecosystem and their replacement is likely to take a century or more due to the slow growth rates of trees. The ecological impacts of prescribed burning on habitat structures used by A. flavipes and other hollow-using species can be moderated by: (1) carrying out patchy, rather than complete burns; (2) ensuring the inter-fire interval is sufficient to allow time for replenishment of resources; and (3) planning at a regional scale to maintain an appropriate spatial pattern of post-fire age-classes, including areas retained as long-unburned (e.g. >50 years) in which resources such as deep litter, large logs and dead trees can accumulate. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Antechinus flavipes; Australia; Box-ironbark; Cavity; Fire; Tree hollow",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049902193

One can mitigate such problems at the strategic level by accounting for potential fire losses in the timber supply planning process by reducing harvest levels to maintain a buffer stock of timber. With a forest planning model based on a timber volume maximizing policy, reducing the harvest level will lead to a reduction in the harvested timber volume and likely, of revenues. One possible solution is to change the policy to increase the value of the wood that is harvested so as to minimize such reductions with less risk. We have evaluated alternative policies for three commercially-managed forests that have different burn rates in northeastern Canada. When compared with a volume-maximization policy, a revenue-maximization policy that considers sustained production and the sale of sawmilling wood products (lumber, chips and sawdust) increased mean revenues by 130% (36–770%) with >0.90 probability and substantially decreased the area and volume harvested by 27% (11–38%) and 28% (14–36%), respectively. By reducing the harvest volume, the total number of jobs associated with forest operations decreased by 20% (10–27%) but the number of jobs per unit area harvested and volume increased. The policy also increased the harvest age and thereby enhanced the retention of a greater proportion of old-growth stands. Our study indicated that a tighter link between strategic planning and wood product processing helped identify better compromises between harvesting activities and revenues, despite the occurrence of natural disturbances. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Boreal forest; Fire; Revenue; Risk analysis; Strategic supply planning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053078766

Our research objective was to determine if repeated applications of fuel reduction treatments resulted in changes in abundance or diversity of beetle (Coleoptera) families, genera, and species within upland mixed hardwood forests in the southern Appalachians Mountains, North Carolina, USA. We established three replicate blocks (∼56 ha) and split each block into four fuel reduction treatments. Treatments included prescribed burning, mechanical felling, a combination of prescribed burning and mechanical felling, and a control (i.e., no fuel reduction techniques applied). We implemented treatments multiple times (2 mechanical thinnings and 4 prescribed burns) over the course of a 15-year period. Using pitfall and colored pan traps, we captured 7037 coleopterans comprised of 62 families over a three-year period. Total coleopteran abundance and diversity were similar across all treatments; however, some beetle families, genera, and species responded to treatments. Nitidulidae were significantly more abundant within controls compared to all other treatments in 2015, whereas Mordellidae generally had higher abundances in mechanical and burns compared to mechanical in 2015 and mechanical and controls in 2016. Chrysomelidae was significantly more abundant in mechanical and burns compared to all other treatments over the entire duration of the study. However, Staphylinidae abundance was significantly lower in mechanical and burns compared to the other treatments. Numerous genera and species also showed variable treatment-level responses. Burn treatments killed some mature trees and reduced forest canopy cover, resulting in higher light availability and thereby greater herbaceous cover and diversity on the forest floor. This vegetation in the understory of burned treatment units may be partially responsible for many of the treatment-level responses of beetle taxa we documented. This study took place after several rounds of fuel reduction techniques were applied over a 15 year period. Some beetle abundance responses were immediate; whereas other groups seemed to be influenced by the application of treatments over time, highlighting the need to examine long-term responses to forest management practices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Appalachian Mountains; Beetles; Chrysomelidae; Fuel reduction; Mechanical thinning; Mordellidae; Nitidulidae; Prescribed fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050160692

Moreover, comparisons of coarse woody debris between old-growth and secondary longleaf pine forests are lacking despite the widely recognized value of deadwood to biodiversity in many forest types. We measured standing and fallen deadwood in three old-growth and four mature (100–125 years-old) secondary forests in two landscapes characterized by either sandy or clayey soils within the historic range of P. palustris. Downed coarse woody debris volume was variable at the old-growth locations, ranging from 2.51 ± 0.79 to 29.10 ± 14.55 m3 per ha, which includes perhaps the lowest values ever reported from any old-growth forest. Factors likely contributing to these low volumes include frequent fire, the low basal area characteristic of this forest type, subtropical climatic conditions of the southeastern Coastal Plain, and large termite populations. The high variability observed among the three old-growth locations probably reflect interactions between fire and other disturbances (e.g., wind damage). The old-growth location on sandy soils had significantly higher coarse woody debris volume and deadwood variety (e.g., diameter increments, posture, tree genera and decay classes) than secondary forests sampled nearby. Highly resinous heartwood is a significant indicator of old-growth conditions relative to secondary locations, appearing to accumulate as a persistent fraction of the deadwood pool over time. © 2018","Fire-adapted; Primary forests; Reference conditions; Virgin forests",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049581068

Fire can influence the formation and persistence of tree hollows. In this study, we investigated the effects of stand-level fire history and individual tree attributes on tree hollow abundance in two forest types in Namadgi National Park in the Australian Capital Territory: subalpine woodlands dominated by Eucalyptus pauciflora Sieber ex Spreng (snow gum); and tall-open E. delegatensis R.T.Baker (alpine ash) montane forest. These forests can be differentiated by their distinct response to fire; E. pauciflora resprouts following fire and E. delegatensis reproduces exclusively via seed. We employed a ground-based approach to measure 1044 trees across 36 sites selected by forest type and fire history as recorded since 1920. For both species, hollow abundance decreased with total fire count at stand level and increased for E. delegatensis in response to an extensive wildfire that occurred in the study area in 2003. The probability of a tree containing a hollow increased with tree diameter and if the tree was dead. Our results show that fire frequency and severity have strong implications for tree hollow abundance in montane and subalpine eucalypt forests. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Eucalyptus; Fire ecology; Fire regime; Habitat; Hollow-bearing tree; Vital attributes",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049316819

In this study, we tested our ability to predict the response of bird communities (128 species) to land-use changes in southern Quebec (~483,100 km2) over the last 30 yr (between 1984–1989 and 2010–2014) by using species distribution models (299,302 occurrences in 30,408 locations) from a hindcasting perspective. Results were grouped by functional guilds to infer potential impacts on ecosystem services, and to relate model transferability (i.e., ability of our models to be generalized to other times and scales) to specific functional and life-history traits. Overall, our models were able to accurately predict, both in space and time, habitat suitability for 69% of species, especially for granivorous, nonmigrant, tree-nesting species, and species that are tied to agricultural areas under intensive use. These findings indicate that model transferability depends upon specific functional and life-history traits, providing further evidence that species’ ecologies affect the ability of models to accurately predict bird distributions. Declining bird species were mostly short-distance migrants that were associated with open habitats (agricultural and nonproductive forest) with aerial insectivorous or granivorous diets, which may be related to agricultural intensification and land abandonment. Land-use changes were positive for some forest bird species that were mainly associated with mixed and deciduous forests, generalist diets and tree-nesting strategies. Yet cavity-nesting birds have suffered substantial reductions in their distributions, suggesting that cumulative effects of intensive logging and wildfires on mature forests pose a threat for forest-specialist species. Habitat suitability changes predicted by our coarse-scale species distribution models partially agreed with the long-term trends reported by the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Our findings confirm land-use change as a key driving force for shaping bird communities in southern Quebec, together with the need to explicitly incorporate it into global change scenarios that better inform decision-makers on conservation and management. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America","agricultural intensification; bird atlas; ecological traits; habitat suitability modeling; hindcasting; land abandonment; temporal transferability",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054089382

Those activities homogenized tree composition and density, modified forest soils, increased risks to insect and disease epidemics, and, in combination with longer drought periods ultimately increased the prevalence of unusually severe wildfires to further homogenize landscapes. Recommendations for restoring structure and function include re-establishing natural fire regimes and disturbance-patch size distributions across landscapes, as well as restoring and maintaining large, old early-seral dominant trees (LOEST), large snags and coarse woody debris, while accounting for physiographic influences. Implementing such recommendations with sensitivity to wildlife conservation requires additional details to account for habitat needs at the planning levels of national forests and districts. We synthesized silviculture-specific literature for wildlife species of greatest conservation concern listed in the strategic wildlife conservation plans of Inland Northwest states (“strategy” species), others of social and economic importance (“focal” species), and some others that are either important in the ecologies of strategy species or otherwise offer literature having particular relevance to MMC silviculture (“facilitative” species). Evaluations of habitat selection behavior and comparisons of species-specific habitat values to tree-stocking guidelines used by silviculturists indicated that most species reviewed are likely to respond positively to restoration, and that a wide array of extant silvicultural methods can be used, provided that large snags and acceptable levels of coarse woody debris are recruited or retained. Thinning followed by routine prescribed burning will be problematic for some wildlife species. Knowledge of wildlife responses to variation in the size distribution of disturbance patches is limited, as is knowledge of wildlife population responses to intentional forestry. Coupling new wildlife research to forest modeling and manipulative experiments within adaptive management and monitoring frameworks will improve predictions of wildlife population responses over the long time frames and multiple spatial scales associated with strategic planning. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptive management; Birds; Forest restoration; Habitat modeling; Landscape collaborative; Landscape simulation; Mammals; Mixed conifer forests; Silviculture; Wildlife conservation",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047266673

The importance of specific plant-animal interactions for the fitness of the interacting groups is mostly driven by the morphological, physiological and behavioural traits of the two interacting species. This work aims to describe dispersal of seeds of the columnar cactus Stenocereus queretaroensis by its main fruit consumers (bats and birds), using the criteria of legitimacy and efficiency. A disperser is legitimate when seeds pass through the gut without losing germination capability, and is efficient if the seeds are transported to places where they have the potential for germination and establishment as seedlings. We conducted direct observations in order to identify the main consumer species of S. queretaroensis fruits. Seed germination was evaluated by comparing those that pass through the gut of two bat species, Artibeus lituratus and Leptonycteris yerbabuenae, and two bird species, Icterus pustulatus and Melanerpes chrysogenys, using the parameters germination percentage and germination rate. To evaluate seed deposition patterns by bats and birds within the study area, 20 seed traps were set: 10 below the canopies of local trees, and 10 in open spaces. Nine species of bats and 13 species of birds were found to consume S. queretaroensis fruits. The four tested species can be considered legitimate dispersers, but germination percentage differed among these disperser species. Seeds defecated by birds show the highest speed of germination and lowest average time to germinate, compared with control seeds. In terms of deposition patterns, however, the bats dropped the highest number of seeds, and deposited them both under the canopy and in open areas, whereas birds drop a lower amount and under the canopy only. © 2018, © 2018 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università di Firenze, Italia.","flying vertebrates; frugivores; germination; passage through gut; seed dispersal; seed rain",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042928756

Fire has spatially variable effects on landscapes; however, for species that benefit from the ephemeral resource patches created by fire, it is critical to understand characteristics of fires that promote postfire colonization and persistence and the spatial scales on which they operate. Using a model postfire specialist, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), we examined how colonization and persistence varied across two spatial scales as a function of four characteristics of fire regimes—fire severity, fire size, fire ignition date and number of years since fire. We modelled black-backed woodpecker colonization and persistence using data from 108 recently burned forests in the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades ecoregions of California, USA, that we monitored for up to 10 years following fire. We employed a novel, spatially hierarchical, dynamic occupancy framework which differentiates colonization and persistence at two spatial scales: across fires and within fires. We found strong effects of fire characteristics on dynamic rates, with colonization and persistence declining across both spatial scales with increasing years since fire. Additionally, at sites within fires, colonization decreased with fire size and increased with fire severity and for fires with later ignition dates. Our results support the notion that different aspects of a species’ environment are important for population processes at different spatial scales. As habitat quality is ephemeral for any given postfire area, our results illustrate the importance of time since fire in structuring occupancy at the fire level, with other characteristics of fires playing larger roles in determining abundance within individual fires. Our results contribute to the broader understanding of how variation in fire characteristics influences the colonization and persistence of species using ephemeral habitats, which is necessary for conserving and promoting postfire biodiversity in the context of rapidly shifting fire regimes. © 2018 The Authors.

Wetlands that support Swamp Pink are exposed to periodic occurrences of wildland fire. However, much is not yet known about the relationship between this species and wildland fire. This study examines plant-level characteristics (i.e., number of leaves, rosette size) in relation to habitat-level characteristics through comparison of Swamp Pink under 2 land-management regimes in different military training zones. We evaluated the forest compositional differences based on the presence/absence of wildland fire and military-training zone in wetlands supporting Swamp Pink and in adjacent uplands using non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMS), multi-response permutation procedures (MRPP), indicator-species analysis (ISA), and measures of density, dominance, herbaceous cover, and species richness. Swamp Pink rosettes in wetlands exposed to fire were significantly larger and averaged nearly 1 more leaf per rosette as compared to those surveyed in wetlands that were not exposed to fire. There was significantly less upland tree density in burned sites compared to unburned sites. We found no relationship between training zones and Swamp Pink size and the number of leaves. Additional differences in forest composition were revealed by comparing training zone and the presence/absence of wildland fire in conjunction with one another. Compared to other areas, the training zones with lower fire-frequency and recent evidence of fire featured significantly larger rosettes with more leaves. In uplands, overall community composition was significantly different among plots exposed to different fire-management strategies (MRPP; P < 0.05), but no such differences occurred in wetlands (P > 0.05). This finding suggests that wetlands limit the effects of fire on community composition. ISA showed that in both wetlands and uplands, different species characterized areas with differing fire influence, suggesting some influence by wildland fire even when such effects were not reflected in overall changes to community composition. The results of this study, the life-history of Swamp Pink, and the distribution of the species in ecosystems characterized by fire (e.g., the New Jersey Pine Barrens) suggest that Swamp Pink is not negatively impacted by fire to a significant degree. The conservation of the Swamp Pink habitat at Fort A.P. Hill may in fact benefit from periodic occurrences of wildland fire. Further research is warranted. © 2018 Humboldt Field Research Institute.

In forests where the availability of cavities has been reduced, artificial cavities may provide surrogate locations. Artificial cavities are typically created using boxes and artificial cavity research has traditionally focused primarily on birds. However, there are numerous cavity-dependent species of mammals that are of regional and global conservation concern, such as the Humboldt marten (Martes caurina humboldtensis). Martens (Martes spp.) are small mustelids that often use cavities for daily resting and seasonal reproductive activities. During June 2013 to September 2015, we tested an artificial cavity design, modified from a design successfully used for European pine martens (M. martes), for the Humboldt marten in northwestern California, USA. We built and installed 16 artificial cavities (“marten” boxes) in marten-occupied areas that have been managed for timber production and likely have reduced cavity availability. We monitored each box with a remote-sensing camera for 2 years to evaluate visitation and use by martens and other cavity-dependent species. Eleven mammal species visited ≥1 boxes and 4 species entered the box to use it. Martens had the greatest number of box-use events, several martens used boxes for resting, and ≥1 female marten used a box for reproductive activities. Our results indicate that our boxes may provide artificial cavities for Humboldt martens in forests where natural cavities have been reduced due to timber harvest or severe wildfire. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018","artificial cavity; California; mammal; marten; Martes; rest structure",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053208126

This study examined tree retention, survival and use by arboreal mammals in 27 small clumps of trees (0.04–0.21 ha) retained at ten partial harvest sites and 24 clumps of trees in nearby unharvested sites in Tasmania, Australia. Harvested sites were assessed on three occasions (1999, 2005–06 and 2014) and unharvested sites on two occasions (2005–06 and 2014). Of the retained clumps in harvested areas, 96% contained at least two habitat trees at the time of first survey (one year after harvest) which is the minimum required under the Tasmanian Forest Practices Code. Loss of retained trees in clumps between 2005–06 and 2014 was higher in harvested sites (average of 11.7% of all trees and 1.5% of habitat trees per clump) than unharvested sites (average of 2.8% of all trees and 0.3% of habitat trees per clump), but was comparable to or lower than rates of loss in many other studies. Trees were more likely to fall if they were dead and had little burn damage at the time of last survey. Factors found to influence tree death included the interaction between burn damage and the size of the tree, with the likelihood of a heavily burnt, average sized tree dying being twice that of an unburnt tree. Scratch marks from arboreal mammals were more prevalent in large trees with visible hollows, particularly in the clumps in harvested areas. In conclusion, the Tasmanian Forest Practices Code provisions were generally implemented as required and the evidence suggests the retained clumps of trees survive and are effective to some degree at providing habitat and promoting recolonisation by fauna in partial harvest coupes. However, further work is required to assess the adequacy of the clump provisions, when combined with management for other values in production forests, for maintaining hollow-using fauna throughout their range. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Conservation planning; Forestry; Habitat trees; Hollow-using fauna; Management prescriptions; Tree cavities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046355258

We compared forage availability, NCC using a 12% and 14% crude protein nutritional constraint, and vegetation composition in untreated mature forest stands, reclaimed surface mines, and 6 timber harvest treatments (timber harvest only, with early growing-season fire, with late growing-season fire, with herbicide only, with herbicide and early growing-season fire, and with herbicide and late growing-season fire). Forage availability in treatments involving timber harvest was greater than in untreated mature forest stands and reclaimed surface mines. Forage availability estimates in treatments involving herbicide and prescribed fire were less than all other timber harvest treatments. Nutritional carrying capacity estimates at the 12% and 14% crude protein constraints were greater in timber harvest treatments and on reclaimed surface mines than in untreated mature forest stands. Herbaceous species coverage was greater and woody species coverage was less on reclaimed surface mines and in timber harvest treatments involving herbicide and prescribed fire than in all other timber harvest treatments and untreated mature forest stands.

Current forest management plans focus on nesting trees, but the incorporation of foraging trees would lead to a more effective management strategy to mitigate habitat loss for this species. We investigated the selection of foraging trees in forests managed for timber extraction and maintenance of wildlife values using foraging observations of 27 radio-tagged adult Williamson's Sapsuckers during the breeding season in 2 regions (Okanagan and Western) of their limited Canadian range. Characteristics of foraging trees (88% of observations on live trees, 11% on dead trees) differed with foraging mode. Large, live Douglas-firs (Pseudotsuga menziesii; ≥22.5 cm dbh) were used for gleaning and sap feeding on tree trunks in both regions, whereas trees used for trunk pecking were mostly large, senescent western larches (Larix occidentalis) in the Okanagan region and large, dead ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa) in the Western region (average dbh = 46 cm). For overall foraging activities, Williamson's Sapsuckers selected large, live Douglas-firs with signs of resin exudation and blistering (pitching), and avoided live lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta), quaking aspens (Populus tremuloides), and ponderosa pines. Larger trees and standing dead conifer trees were reused more often for foraging than smaller and live trees. The quality of Williamson's Sapsucker habitat could decrease over the long term if forest management practices reduce the overall size of trees or alter tree species composition to promote lodgepole pine. Forest management should focus on retaining and promoting large live Douglas-fir trees and large senescent or standing dead conifers (also used for nesting), which can be achieved by using thinning, prescribed fire, partial harvesting, and tree retention strategies. © 2018 American Ornithological Society.","Foraging habitat; large trees; montane forest; Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca; resource selection function; Sphyrapicus thyroideus; telemetry; woodpecker",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051218996

To accomplish this goal, managers require information about reference conditions in different forest types, as well as tools to determine which individual trees to retain or remove to approximate those reference conditions. We used dendroecological reconstructions and General Land Office records to quantify historical forest structure and composition within a 13,600 ha study area in eastern Oregon where the USDA Forest Service is planning restoration treatments. Our analysis demonstrates that all forest types present in the study area, ranging from dry ponderosa pine-dominated forests to moist mixed conifer forests, are considerably denser (273–316% increase) and have much higher basal area (60–176% increase) today than at the end of the 19th century. Historically, both dry pine and mixed conifer forest types were dominated by shade-intolerant species. Today, shade-tolerant tree cover has increased in dry pine stands, while mixed conifer stands are now dominated by shade-tolerant species. Federal managers in eastern Oregon are currently required to retain all live trees >53 cm diameter at breast height in the course of forest management activities because this size class is assumed to be under-represented on the landscape relative to historical conditions. However, we found the same or greater number of live trees >53 cm today than in the late 19th century. Restoring historical conditions usually involves removing shade-tolerant trees that established since Euro-American management significantly altered natural disturbance regimes. We evaluated a wide range of tree morphological and environmental variables that could potentially predict the age of grand fir and Douglas-fir, the most abundant shade-tolerant species found within the study area. We describe several morphological characteristics that are diagnostic of tree age and developed decision trees that predict the approximate age of trees using morphological characteristics that are easy to measure in the field such as height to live foliage or height to dead branches. Information about structural and compositional change over time combined with tree-age prediction tools provides a flexible framework for restoring historical conditions and meeting other resource management objectives. © 2018 The Authors.","Blue Mountains Forest Partners; Collaborative Forest Landscape Restoration Program (CFLRP); conditional inference trees; dendroecology; eastern Oregon; General Land Office (GLO); historical conditions; Malheur National Forest; tree morphology; USDA Forest Service",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054071633

In such cases, prioritizing long-vacant patches for restoration is an intuitively appealing strategy for minimizing the effects on endangered species. Metapopulation models grounded in empirical data potentially provide a rigorous framework for developing theoretical “patch vacancy thresholds” (i.e., duration of vacancy required before implementing restoration) and assessing the implications of such criteria for restoration objectives. We develop such a model for spotted owls (Strix occidentalis), which embody the species–ecosystem dilemma given their preference for closed-canopy forests that are also susceptible to severe fire and drought and hence the center of debates about forest restoration intended to reduce fire and drought risk. We leveraged a >20-year territory occupancy dataset to parameterize a Stochastic Patch Occupancy Model (SPOM) to assess relative risk to a metapopulation of owls in California under alternative conservation guidelines, including a range of vacancy thresholds. Territories with greater amounts of owl habitat were more likely to be recolonized and less likely to go extinct. Importantly, the probability of a vacant owl territory becoming recolonized declined as length of vacancy increased; territories vacant for 1 and 10 years had annual recolonization probabilities of 0.34 and 0.06, respectively. Based on our SPOM, projected territory occupancy rates declined as the vacancy threshold decreased and as habitat within territories was impacted by restoration. However, more liberal territory vacancy thresholds were projected to increase the proportion of territories (and thus landscape) that could be restored and that restored conditions could be maintained with repeated treatments. Reintroducing natural disturbance regimes, which eliminated the need for repeated treatments, was projected to reduce risk to owls, particularly with relaxed vacancy thresholds. We provide a simple, yet novel, metapopulation framework for quantifying how alternative conservation guidelines might impact owl occupancy and influence forest restoration guidelines. Similar analyses could facilitate restoration efforts in other systems by more explicitly quantifying tradeoffs between species–ecosystem objectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Metapopulation model; Patch occupancy; Recolonization; Spotted owl; Strix occidentalis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048714515

Our objective was to map abundance and provide a population estimate of black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains of South Dakota and Wyoming, USA. We conducted 3,666 and 3,384 5-minute point count surveys from late-March to late-June in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We characterized vegetation around each point using geographic information system-derived landscape variables and fit 3-level hierarchical time-removal models in R package unmarked using gmultmix. The global abundance model received the most support and included year, latitude, and percent area of green trees, beetle-killed trees, dead trees, 1- to 2-year-old wildfire, 3-year-old wildfire, and 4- to 5-year-old wildfire. Points with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees had the greatest density of black-backed woodpeckers, followed by 1- to 2-year-old wildfires. After 4 years, areas burned by wildfire supported lower densities of black-backed woodpeckers than undisturbed forests. Mean density was 0.528 birds/km2 in 2015 and 0.626 birds/km2 in 2016. There were an estimated 2,920 and 3,439 black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We suggest areas with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees may support high densities of black-backed woodpeckers and are important to sustaining populations when the availability of recent (&lt;4 years old) wildfire is declining or scarce.

In the temperate forests and woodlands of eastern and southern Australia, the loss of large, old trees and associated tree hollows has severely impacted populations of hollow-dependent fauna. In the tropical savannas of northern Australia, many hollow-dependent mammals are in decline, and habitat simplification and resultant hollow limitation have been suggested as potential contributors to these declines. Hence, we sought to quantify the abundance of hollows, and identify the key drivers of this abundance in northern Australian savannas. We modelled the environmental and ecological correlates of hollow abundance across an extensive area of eucalypt savanna in Australia's Northern Territory. We found that hollow abundance was significantly related to tree characteristics (size, species) and broad environmental gradients (annual rainfall, soil depth). Key disturbances – cyclones, fire, and termites – substantially disrupted these relationships and led to high variation in hollow abundance, even at a local scale. Hollow abundance across the study area was high by both Australian and global standards (hollows &gt;5 cm entrance diameter: 88 ha–1, hollows &gt;10 cm: 23 ha–1) and greatest in high rainfall areas (associated with the abundance of large eucalypts). Many arboreal mammal species in northern Australia have now contracted to higher rainfall parts of their former range (where hollows are at highest density); however such higher rainfall areas are also more likely to be affected by stochastic cyclonic events that can severely reduce the abundance of hollows. Hollow abundance was also affected by recent fire history and, in many areas, the current regime of frequent, high intensity fires will lead to marked reduction in this resource. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Arboreal fauna; Disturbance ecology; Eucalypt woodland; Hollow-bearing trees; Tree cavities",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044781446

Research studies have assessed effects of prescribed fire and burn frequency on plants and vertebrates, but impacts of fire on terrestrial invertebrate communities are still poorly understood. This case study investigated effects of burning frequency on species richness and community composition of social insects (ants, Hymenoptera: Formicidae and termites, Blattodea: Isoptera) in fire-managed Southern longleaf pine flatwoods in central Florida. Community response to different fire frequencies was assessed: burned annually, every 2 yr, or every 3 yr, 30 yr unburned and 75 yr unburned. Richness was similar across all treatments, but ant community composition and species density significantly differed between frequently burned (1, 2, and 3 yr) and long-unburned (30 and 75 yr) treatments. Long-unburned treatments had higher ant abundance, but the species present were less characteristic of open canopy longleaf pine habitat than ants in frequently burned treatments. The annual burn treatment differed from 2-yr burn in species density, but to a lesser degree. Exotic species abundance was highest in frequently burned sites; only native species were detected in the 75-yr unburned plot. The red imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta Buren (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), was detected in all regularly burned plots but not in long-unburned sites. Frequent burning at this site increased habitat suitability for ant species adapted to the sunny, open canopy, and diverse niches characteristic of longleaf pine forest; however, regular fire disturbance also increased the likelihood of exotic ant species establishment. © The Author(s) 2018.","ants; leaf litter; mesic flatwoods; prescribed fire; social insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048605909

Previous research has indicated that salvage logging, the removal of dead and dying trees from burned forests, has a negative effect on nesting densities of Black-backed Woodpeckers. One strategy proposed to ameliorate the impacts of dead tree removal on Black-backed Woodpeckers is to retain patches, or islands, of dense snags within the salvage matrix, but this approach remains largely untested. Following the Angora fire of South Lake Tahoe, CA several snag islands were retained within the larger salvage prescription to conserve habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers and other snag-associated species. In this observational study, we evaluate whether these snag islands were effective at maintaining Black-backed Woodpecker populations following logging operations that covered 45% of the burned area. We systematically searched the postfire landscape for Black-backed Woodpecker nests for two years before and after salvage operations and compared nesting densities between logged and unlogged areas. Similar to other studies, we found that nest densities at the stand scale declined significantly in areas that were salvage logged, but Black-backed Woodpeckers did nest in both snag islands and in other peripheral unlogged areas, indicating that this approach may help balance habitat for wildlife with management needs at the scale of the fire. In this study, the removal of dead trees, which is usually implemented in the first two years following fire, did not occur until the fourth year, which may have also contributed to the persistence of Black-backed Woodpeckers postlogging. © 2018 by the author(s).","Black-backed woodpecker; Postfire; Salvage logging; Snag island; Snag retention",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049186921

However, little work has been conducted in flammable ecosystems where spatially and temporally dynamic fire edges are expected to influence important processes such as recolonization of burnt areas and landscape connectivity. We review the literature on fire, fauna, and edge effects to summarize current knowledge of faunal responses to fire edges and identify knowledge gaps. We then develop a conceptual model to predict faunal responses to fire edges and present an agenda for future research. Faunal abundance at fire edges changes over time, but patterns depend on species traits and resource availability. Responses are also influenced by edge architecture (e.g., size and shape), site and landscape context, and spatial scale. However, data are limited and the influence of fire edges on both local abundance and regional distributions of fauna is largely unknown. In our conceptual model, biophysical properties interact with the fire regime (e.g., patchiness, frequency) to influence edge architecture. Edge architecture and species traits influence edge permeability, which is linked to important processes such as movement, resource selection, and species interactions. Predicting the effect of fire edges on fauna is challenging, but important for biodiversity conservation in flammable landscapes. Our conceptual model combines several drivers of faunal fire responses (biophysical properties, regime attributes, species traits) and will therefore lead to improved predictions. Future research is needed to understand fire as an agent of edge creation; the spatio-temporal flux of fire edges across landscapes; and the effect of fire edges on faunal movement, resource selection, and biotic interactions. To aid the incorporation of new data into our predictive framework, our model has been designed as a Bayesian Network, a statistical tool capable of analyzing complex environmental relationships, dealing with data gaps, and generating testable hypotheses. © 2018 The Authors.

Working in montane riparian areas in Rocky Mountain National Park (USA), we seeded 1 m2 plots on bare soil patches created by a wildfire and monitored germination and survival. Seeds germinated in 46% of the plots and the number of seedlings ranged from 1 to 591. Plots with higher average growing season soil moisture had greater numbers of seedlings and seedling survival rates. In a nearby unburned valley, we assessed aerial seed rain biweekly using traps established at the same locations as a previous study in 2000. Five years after the establishment of exclosures, aerial seed rain was lower than in the pre-fence year 2000. We conclude that fire could trigger willow seeding establishment and controlled burns used as a viable option for restoration. In addition, five years of fencing is insufficient to reestablish willow seed rain after a period of heavy browsing. © 2018 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.","Riparian restoration; Rocky Mountain National Park; Salicaceae; Salix spp.; Ungulate browsing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048588894

However, concern has been expressed about whether high-severity fire might result in persistent type conversion to nonforest, or from pine (Pinus spp.) dominance to forest predominantly consisting of white fir (Abies concolor), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), and incense-cedar (Calocedrus decurrens), as opposed to heterogeneous natural succession and ephemeral occurrence of CESF. If type conversion is common, it could in time harm other at-risk species that depend on dense, late-successional forest for some of their habitat needs. I investigated postfire patterns in high-severity fire patches within yellow pine (Pinus ponderosa and Pinus jeffreyi) and mixed-conifer forests in California, USA, using field plots evenly spaced along random transects into the interior of patches within fires that occurred from 1999 to 2013. I found natural conifer regeneration in ≥80% of plots, even >300 m into patches. Conifer regeneration was greater closer to low–moderate-severity areas. Areas with lower conifer regeneration, where CESF would have the greatest longevity—comprised only 4.6% of these fire areas. Pine species dominated regeneration deeper into the interior of large high-severity patches, and fir–cedar-dominated at patch edges. Shrubs did not impede conifer regeneration, but greater densities of conifer saplings reduced shrubs, and sapling growth increased with time-since-fire. My findings suggest heterogeneous land-cover patterns are resulting from natural succession in high-severity fire patches. © 2018 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2018","complex early seral forest; conifer regeneration; fire severity; postfire succession; wildlife",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045265951

We built on previous research on avian responses to fire by investigating how complex effects of burn severity and time since fire influenced avian community composition across the northern Sierra Nevada, California. We conducted avian point counts from 2009 to 2015 in 10 fires that burned between 2000 and 2014, resulting in a chronosequence of 1–15 yr post-fire. We estimated the effects of burn severity, time since fire, non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity and time since fire, pre-fire forest conditions, and several physiographic parameters on the density of 44 breeding bird species using hierarchical distance sampling models. In addition, we fit separate models to observations of each species in unburned forest to compare species’ densities between burned and unburned forests. At least one of the non-linear or interaction fire effects was significant for 27 (61%) of the 44 bird species. The quadratic effect of time since fire was an important predictor of post-fire densities of 20 species, illustrating the dynamic nature of this post-wildfire avian community. Greater maximum densities were estimated at some combination of burn severity and time since fire than in unburned forest for 13 of the 44 (30%) species, only one of which reached maximum density following low-severity fire. In contrast, all of the 12 species that were more abundant in unburned forest reached maximum post-fire densities in fires that burned at low severity. Results from the study suggest that consideration of the non-linear and interacting effects of fire severity and time since fire is important to fully understanding post-wildfire responses for a majority of birds. Moreover, the study supports a growing body of literature that indicates mixed-severity fire is essential for conserving avian diversity in many fire-maintained systems. © 2018 The Authors.","distance sampling; disturbance; pyrodiversity; Sierra Nevada; succession",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050758660

We used photographic images to capture various forest management treatments of different intensity levels and times after treatments, and assessed users' perception of scenic beauty and recreation satisfaction. Results indicated variation among users participating in different recreation activities, but that good quality RCW habitats offered both higher scenic beauty and higher recreation satisfaction than poor quality habitats for most activity user groups. Finally, recreation satisfaction was statistically equal to perceived scenic beauty from both good and poor-quality RCW habitats for most of the activity user groups, thus suggesting the importance of scenic beauty of forest sites in determining recreation users' attainment of visit satisfaction. Findings conclude that forest sites developed as good quality RCW habitats in the present state also offer quality experience to recreation users, thus supporting multi-objective forestry practices in public forests. © 2018 by the author.","Controlled burning; Forest beauty; Graphic elicitation technique; Ocala National Forest; Outdoor recreation; Red-cockaded woodpecker",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046666705

We remeasured these plots repeatedly during the first post-fire decade to examine how the attributes changed through time and whether changes were influenced by fire severity. We found that most attributes were temporally dynamic and that fire severity shaped their dynamics. For example, low-severity plots experienced a modest reduction in live overstory density due to both immediate and delayed tree mortality, and no change in live overstory basal area through time; in contrast, high-severity plots experienced an immediate and total loss of live overstory density and basal area. Large snag density in low-severity plots did not vary temporally because snag recruitment balanced snag loss; however, in high-severity plots large snag density increased markedly immediately post-fire and then declined by about half by post-fire year ten as snags fell. Mineral soil cover increased modestly immediately post-fire in low-severity plots and substantially immediately post-fire in high-severity plots, but changed little in ensuing years for either severity class. By incorporating pre-fire and repeatedly-measured post-fire data for a range of severities, our study uniquely contributes to the current understanding of wildfire effects in dry conifer forests and should be of interest to managers, researchers, and others. © 2018 by the authors.

However, prescribed fire may alter habitat availability while female eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) are reproductively active. In addition, the vigor of vegetation regrowth post-fire is impacted by both midstory and overstory stand-conditions which can be a function of stand age. Therefore, the degree to which prescribed fire affects habitat availability and selection of wild turkeys may be a function of both time-since-fire and the age of the stand fire was applied to. We assessed habitat selection of female wild turkeys during their reproductive cycle in a longleaf pine forest managed with frequent prescribed fire. We captured 63 female wild turkeys during 2015 and 2016 on a longleaf pine-dominated landscape in southwestern Georgia, USA, that was managed with 1–3 year fire-return intervals applied to relatively small burn blocks (mean size of burn = 26.02 ha in 2015; 19.84 ha in 2016) on pine stands of varying age-classes. We attached Global Positioning Systems units to individuals and collected hourly locations from 1 March to 15 August. We then used distance-based analyses to estimate daily selection or avoidance of vegetation communities relative to the known reproductive phenology of individual females. Females selected hardwood stands during pre-nesting and post-nesting phases, but avoided them during the incubation phase. Females used open vegetation communities during all phases of reproduction following pre-nesting. Turkeys selected areas burned ≤2 years prior but used different seral stages of pine during different reproductive phases. Specifically, females selected for recently burned mature pine stands during incubation but then selected for recently burned young pine stands, mature pine stands burned 2 years earlier, and open vegetation communities during brooding. Our findings demonstrate that time-since-fire and stand seral age interact to affect how turkeys use pyric landscapes. In general, pine stands providing ample understory vegetation are favored while females are reproductively active. Our data suggests practitioners should try to manage a landscape containing both young and mature pine stands and use prescribed fire to create understory conditions selected by turkeys across all reproductive phases. © 2018","Distance-based habitat selection; Forest management; Longleaf pine; Meleagris gallopavo; Pinus palustris; Prescribed fire; Resource selection; Space use",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041476818

We assessed the contribution of wildfire to forest dynamics in the eastern Cascade Mountains, USA from 1985 to 2010 using imputed maps of forest structure (i.e., tree size and canopy cover) and remotely sensed burn severity maps. We addressed three questions: (1) How do dynamics differ between the region as a whole and the unburned portion of the region? (2) How do dynamics vary among vegetation zones differing in biophysical setting and historical fire frequency? (3) How have forest structural conditions changed in a network of late successional reserves (LSRs)? Wildfires affected 10% of forests in the region, but the cumulative effects at this scale were primarily slight losses of closed-canopy conditions and slight gains in open-canopy conditions. In the unburned portion of the region (the remaining 90%), closed-canopy conditions primarily increased despite other concurrent disturbances (e.g., harvest, insects). Although the effects of fire were largely dampened at the regional scale, landscape scale dynamics were far more variable. The warm ponderosa pine and cool mixed conifer zones experienced less fire than the region as a whole despite experiencing the most frequent fire historically. Open-canopy conditions increased slightly in the mixed conifer zone, but declined across the ponderosa pine zone even with wildfires. Wildfires burned 30% of the cold subalpine zone, which experienced the greatest increase in open-canopy conditions and losses of closed-canopy conditions. LSRs were more prone to wildfire than the region as a whole, and experienced slight declines in late seral conditions. Despite losses of late seral conditions, wildfires contributed to some conservation objectives by creating open habitats (e.g., sparse early seral and woodland conditions) that otherwise generally decreased in unburned landscapes despite management efforts to increase landscape diversity. This study demonstrates the potential for wildfires to contribute to regional scale conservation objectives, but implications for management and biodiversity at landscape scales vary geographically among biophysical settings, and are contingent upon historical dynamics and individual species habitat preferences. © 2017 by the Ecological Society of America.","eastern Cascades; gradient nearest neighbor; late successional reserves; mixed conifer; ponderosa pine; regional forest dynamics; subalpine; wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042685529

However, the consequences of the potentially declining importance of vegetation in determining future disturbance regimes are not well understood. Historically, bark beetles preferentially attack older trees and stands in later stages of development. However, as climate warming intensifies outbreaks by promoting growth of beetle populations and compromising tree defenses, smaller diameter trees and stands in early stages of development now are being affected by outbreaks. To date, no study has considered how stand age and other pre-outbreak forest conditions mediate the effects of outbreaks on surface and aerial fuel arrangements. We collected fuels data across a chronosequence of post-outbreak sites affected by spruce beetle (SB) between the 1940s and the 2010s, stratified by young (<130 yr) and old (>130 yr) post-fire stands. Canopy and surface fuel loads were calculated for each tree and stand, and available crown fuel load, crown bulk density, and canopy bulk densities were estimated. Canopy bulk density and density of live canopy individuals were reduced in all stands affected by SB, though foliage loss was proportionally greater in old stands as compared to young stands. Fine surface fuel loads in young stands were three times greater shortly (<30 yr) following outbreak as compared to young stands not affected by outbreak, after which the abundance of fine surface fuels decreased to below endemic (i.e., non-outbreak) levels. In both young and old stands, the net effect of SB outbreaks during the 20th and 21st centuries reduced total canopy fuels and increased stand-scale spatial heterogeneity of canopy fuels following outbreak. Importantly, the decrease in canopy fuels following outbreaks was greater in young post-fire stands than in older stands, suggesting that SB outbreaks may more substantially reduce risk of active crown fire when they affect stands in earlier stages of development. The current study shows that the effects of SB outbreaks on forest structure and on fuel profiles are strongly contingent on pre-outbreak conditions as determined by pre-outbreak disturbance history. © 2018 by the Ecological Society of America.","conifer forests; Dendroctonus rufipennis Kirby; disturbance interactions; disturbance legacies; fuel heterogeneity; linked disturbances; natural disturbances; Picea engelmannii; Rocky Mountains, USA; western U.S. forests",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042711889

This will impose severe challenges for many biota through exposure to rapidly changing conditions never experienced in the preceding millennia. Thus, it is urgently needed to gain a thorough understanding of animal responses and adaptations to disturbances in order to better estimate potential future impacts. Here, we review such adjustments and find that animals may respond to disturbances through changes in: (1) behaviour, such as altered mobility, emigration, resource-switching, refuge use, suspended animation, or biotic interactions; (2) life history traits, such as survival, aging, longevity, recruitment, reproductive restraint, breeding output, phenology and bet-hedging tactics; (3) morphology, such as rapid evolution through size-dependent mortality or facultative metamorphosis; (4) physiology, such as altered body condition, pathogen prevalence and transmission, or adrenocortical modulation of stress responses to emergency conditions; (5) genetic structure, such as changes in frequency of polymorphic variants or diversity-modulation through mortality bottlenecks. Individual-level responses scale up to population and community responses, such as altered density, population dynamics, distribution, local extinction and colonization, or assemblage structure and diversity. Overall, disturbances have pervasive effects on individuals, populations and communities of vertebrates and invertebrates of all realms, biomes, continents and ecosystems. Their rapidly increasing incidence and severity will bring unique study opportunities for researchers and novel, unpredictable challenges for managers, while demanding tougher choices and more proactive crisis-preparation for conservationists, as well as mentality changes for all. Under all conditions, disturbances may soon become the defining signatures of most ecosystems and the dynamic leitmotif of modern ecology. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Behaviour; Climate extremes; Demography; Disturbance; Impact; Life history; Perturbation",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037375895

We simulated the effects of upland tree basal area (ie total cross-sectional area of trees per land area) and different upland management approaches on wetland hydrological, biogeochemical, and habitat functions. Increases in upland basal area and associated forest evapotranspiration reduced wetland inundation depth and duration. Wetland global warming potential decreased with higher upland basal area, driven by lower methane production in drier wetlands. Amphibian habitat suitability decreased with increasing basal area due to reduced wetland inundation. Simulations of three common 25-year management scenarios – namely, constant basal area, fire management, and pine plantation – highlighted impacts of forest structure that vary over time. Prescribed fires that recurred every 3 years generated cyclic patterns in wetland hydrology and function, whereas pine plantations transitioned from wet to dry regimes with stand growth. This work represents a first step to linking upland management, wetland hydrology, and wetland functions, highlighting opportunities for optimizing forest management to provide landscape-scale ecosystem services. © The Ecological Society of America",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040248088

The abundance, volume, size, and distribution of snags can affect wildlife communities and stand-level biological diversity. Characteristics such as the wood properties of different tree species, environmental conditions, and cause of tree death (e.g., insects, disease, senescence, wind, fire) can influence decomposition and subsequent use of snags by wildlife. The objectives of this study were to characterize decay patterns in jack pine (Pinus banksiana) snags that had been killed by prescribed fire, topping, and girdling and determine the effects of these treatments on subsequent snag use by subcortical insects and primary cavity-nesting birds. The prescribed fire, topping, and girdling treatments were implemented in 2003, 2004, and 2007, respectively; bird excavations were quantified in 2014 and insect activity was measured in 2016. One-way analysis of variance tests were used to examine any differences among treatments in snag characteristics, decay characteristics, past insect activity, and past use by birds. An information theoretic approach to model selection was then used to rank potential predictors of bird foraging activity and cavities. The topping treatment had unique decay characteristics relative to the other two treatments; topped snags had the highest levels of past insect colonization, were softer, and had higher proportions of loose bark remaining on the boles. Trees killed by prescribed fire had the greatest number of foraging excavations and cavities. Girdled snags had the lowest evidence of past insect colonization and showed different levels of decay and insect use at different vertical positions on the snag bole. Comparison of candidate models showed that a model containing treatment type alone was the highest ranked when predicting foraging by birds, while snag diameter was the highest ranked when predicting the presence of cavities. A model containing treatment and snag density was also a highly ranked for predicting cavity presence. Our findings suggest that different jack pine snag treatments result in unique decay trajectories that may influence snag use by an array of wildlife taxa. Our characterization of three snag creation treatments can also inform options for generating snags, depending on the desired outcome, when management for biological legacies and wildlife habitat is of interest within mixed-pine forests of the Great Lakes region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ecological forestry; Fire; Jack pine; Snags; Subcortical insects; Woodpeckers",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036450899

The spatial pattern of burn severity may compound the ecological impacts of fire through distances to seed sources and availability of bud banks and seedbeds. Land managers require spatial burn severity data to manage post-fire risks, ecosystem recovery, and assess the outcomes of fires. This research seeks to characterize and explain variability in burn severity in the northwestern boreal forest. We assessed burn severity one year post-fire in six large wildfires that burned in 2014. We measured burn severity using the Composite Burn Index, surface Burn Severity Index, Canopy Fire Severity Index, and percent overstory mortality, describing a range of surface and overstory fire effects. Burn severity was variable, ranging from unburned residuals to complete overstory mortality and intense combustion. We related field measurements to remotely sensed multispectral burn severity metrics of the differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR), the Relativized dNBR, and the Relativized Burn Ratio. Diagnostic models of burn severity using relativized metrics had lower errors and better (though not significantly so) fits to the field data. Spatial patterns of burn severity were consistent with those observed in other large fires in North America. Stand-replacing patches were large, aggregated, and covered the largest proportion of the landscape. These patterns were not consistent across the four mapped burn severity field metrics, suggesting such metrics may be viewed as related, but complementary, as they depict different aspects of severity. Prognostic models indicated burn severity was explained by pre-fire stand structure and composition, topoedaphic context, and fire weather at time of burning. Wetlands burned less severely than uplands, and open stands with high basal areas experienced lower burn severity in upland vegetation communities. This research offers an enhanced understanding of the relationship between ground observations and remotely sensed severity metrics, in conjunction with stand-level drivers of burn severity. The diverse fuel complexes and extreme fire weather during the 2014 fire season produced the complex patterns and broad range of burn severity observed. © 2018 Whitman et al.","boreal forest; burn severity; fire severity; fire weather; forest fire; fuel structure; topoedaphic context; wildfire",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043366764

Such models do not usually represent important processes explicitly related to climate change and harvesting, which limits their potential for predicting and understanding the future of boreal bird assemblages at the landscape scale. In this study, we attempted to assess the cumulative and specific impacts of both harvesting and climate-induced changes on wildfires and stand-level processes (e.g., reproduction, growth) in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. The projected changes in these landscape- and stand-scale processes (referred to as “drivers of change”) were then assessed for their impacts on future habitats and potential productivity of black-backed woodpecker (BBWO; Picoides arcticus), a focal species representative of deadwood and old-growth biodiversity in eastern Canada. Forest attributes were simulated using a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, and were used to infer future landscape suitability to BBWO under three anthropogenic climate forcing scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), compared to the historical baseline. We found climate change is likely to be detrimental for BBWO, with up to 92% decline in potential productivity under the worst-case climate forcing scenario (RCP 8.5). However, large declines were also projected under baseline climate, underlining the importance of harvest in determining future BBWO productivity. Present-day harvesting practices were the single most important cause of declining areas of old-growth coniferous forest, and hence appeared as the single most important driver of future BBWO productivity, regardless of the climate scenario. Climate-induced increases in fire activity would further promote young, deciduous stands at the expense of old-growth coniferous stands. This suggests that the biodiversity associated with deadwood and old-growth boreal forests may be greatly altered by the cumulative impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances under a changing climate. Management adaptations, including reduced harvesting levels and strategies to promote coniferous species content, may help mitigate these cumulative impacts. Copyright: © 2018 Tremblay et al.

Habitat loss and degradation, largely related to fire suppression, are believed to be the major causes of population declines, but these relationships are less studied at the northern range-extent. Hence, we investigated habitat selection of Bachman's Sparrow on Fort Bragg Military Installation, where vegetation is characterized by extensive fire-maintained Pinus palustris (Longleaf Pine) uplands. We surveyed breeding male sparrows using repeat-visit point-counts. We visited 182 points 3 times from April to July during the 2014 and 2015 breeding seasons. We measured vegetation and distance to other habitat features (e.g., wildlife openings, streams) at each point. We recorded presence or absence of Bachman's Sparrows and fit encounter histories into a single-season occupancy model in program Unmarked, including a year effect on detection. Occupancy probability was 0.52 and increased with greater grass-cover and at intermediate distances from wildlife openings, and decreased with years-since-fire and with greater shrub height. Predictors of Bachman's Sparrow occupancy were similar to those reported for other portions of the range, supporting the importance of frequent prescribed fire to maintain herbaceous groundcover used by birds for nesting and foraging.

Such misunderstanding is a barrier to future old-growth management and conservation. To quantify, characterize, and conserve these remnants, we conducted inventories for five species of old-growth southern pines on 16 sites across 44,110 forested ha managed by the Florida Park Service. We used characteristics of old-growth pines and forests from the literature to locate potential sites and assess status and threats. This inventory documented 4697.5 ha of old-growth southern pines in 16 parks throughout Florida. The median size stand we inventoried or included due to existing documentation is 121 ha, with stands as small as eight ha and as large as 2020 ha. Despite their small relative extent, these stands harbor rare, threatened, or endangered species and represent significant conservation areas in the region. A threat common to most of the old-growth stands in Florida State Parks is complications from reintroduction of prescribed fire following prolonged fire exclusion. Heavy fuel loading and invasion of off-site species has resulted in high post-fire mortality linked to both forest floor duff consumption and overstory crown consumption. Management measures are presented to improve conditions of old-growth southern pines in Florida State Parks, and have relevance to broader conservation efforts in the southeastern USA.","fire reintroduction; old-growth; Pinus elliottii var. densa; Pinus palustris; prescribed burning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041241543

To aid this decision-making process, we summarize recent research findings pertaining to the Sierra Nevada region of California, USA to identify contexts in which active reforestation or passive recovery may best promote desirable post-fire ecological trajectories. Based on our synthesis, we suggest conceptual frameworks for assessing landscape conditions and determining areas that may be the highest priorities for tree planting to avoid persistent loss of conifer forests. Field studies have shown that some large patches of high severity burn can have relatively low levels of natural regeneration, especially among desired pine species. The accumulation of fuels and competition with shrubs and resprouting hardwoods may hinder the reestablishment of mature conifer trees. However, severe fires could also play a restorative role, by promoting non-conifer forested communities, such as meadows, shrubfields, and open forests with significant hardwood components. Such communities were historically rejuvenated and maintained by fire but have been replaced by conifer forest due in part to fire suppression. Reforestation in such areas may run counter to restoring ecological function and the ecosystem services that are provided by non-conifer communities. Through this framework, managers and stakeholders may better understand the contexts in which planting and passive recovery may better support ecological restoration. © 2018, This is a U.S. government work and its text is not subject to copyright protection in the United States; however, its text may be subject to foreign copyright protection.","Biodiversity; Landscape restoration; Meadow restoration; Natural regeneration; Planting; Shrub competition; Succession",Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053397162

The purpose of this study was to assess how the number of snags (standing dead trees) is associated with the breeding bird community and to document how the number of snags at a site varied over a 23 y period of restoration by fire. The effect of snags on bird communities was studied by establishing bird census plots along a wide range of snag abundances. To determine for what purposes birds utilized snags, observers documented all visits during an hour-long period for pairs of a dead and live tree. Change in the abundance of snags over time was documented over 23 y in a 16 ha grid. We found both bird species richness and abundance were positively associated with the number of snags and that birds used dead trees for mating and reproductive purposes more than live trees. We found the introduction of fire for restoration purposes initially resulted in an increase in the number of snags, but repeated fires eventually caused the number of snags to decline substantially. If a primary goal of savanna restoration is to enhance breeding bird community, our results show how burn regimes can be managed to maximize the number of dead tree snags for as long as possible.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040356507

Despite potential negative effects on biodiversity, salvage logging is often conducted, even in areas otherwise excluded from logging and reserved for nature conservation, inter alia because strategic priorities for post-disturbance management are widely lacking. A review of the existing literature revealed that most studies investigating the effects of salvage logging on biodiversity have been conducted less than 5 years following natural disturbances, and focused on non-saproxylic organisms. A meta-analysis across 24 species groups revealed that salvage logging significantly decreases numbers of species of eight taxonomic groups. Richness of dead wood dependent taxa (i.e. saproxylic organisms) decreased more strongly than richness of non-saproxylic taxa. In contrast, taxonomic groups typically associated with open habitats increased in the number of species after salvage logging. By analysing 134 original species abundance matrices, we demonstrate that salvage logging significantly alters community composition in 7 of 17 species groups, particularly affecting saproxylic assemblages. Synthesis and applications. Our results suggest that salvage logging is not consistent with the management objectives of protected areas. Substantial changes, such as the retention of dead wood in naturally disturbed forests, are needed to support biodiversity. Future research should investigate the amount and spatio-temporal distribution of retained dead wood needed to maintain all components of biodiversity. © 2017 The Authors.

Objectives: We assessed how landscape composition, fragmentation, and disturbance affected occurrence and within-season site-fidelity of a declining grassland songbird species (Henslow’s Sparrow, Ammodramus henslowii). Methods: Our study area encompassed eastern Kansas (USA) and North America’s largest remaining tracts of tallgrass prairie. We conducted 10,292 breeding-season point-count surveys over 2 years, and related occurrence and within-season site-occupancy dynamics of sparrows to landscape attributes within 400-, 800-, and 1600-m radii. Results: Sparrows inhabited < 1% of sites, appearing and disappearing locally within and between breeding seasons. Early in spring, sparrows responded to landscape attributes most strongly within 400-m radii, settling in areas containing > 50% unburned prairie. Later in summer, sparrows responded to landscape attributes most strongly within 800-m radii, settling in areas containing > 50% unfragmented prairie, including sites burned earlier the same year. Sparrows avoided landscapes containing woody vegetation, disappeared from hayfields after mowing, and were most likely to inhabit landscapes containing Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) fields embedded within rangeland. Conclusions: Landscape context influenced habitat selection at spatial scales broader than both the territory and habitat patch. Protecting contiguous prairies from agricultural conversion and woody encroachment, promoting CRP enrollment, and maintaining portions of undisturbed prairie in working rangelands each year are critical to reversing the conservation crisis in North America’s remaining grasslands. As landscape change alters natural areas worldwide, effective conservation requires suitable conditions for threatened species at multiple spatial scales. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Grassland birds; Habitat fragmentation; Habitat loss; Matrix effects; Multiscale",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030713738

In this study, we addressed changes in local populations of Magellanic Woodpeckers (Campephilus magellanicus) occupying three national parks of central-southern Chile. We compared the breeding and postbreeding abundance of woodpeckers during the 1990s with the present (2016) abundance (n = 4 years), and assessed the extent to which abundance was explained by forest type and quality of foraging habitat (as quantified through the plant senescence reflectance index; PSRI). Results show a distinctive temporal variation in woodpecker abundance at each park, with local populations of Magellanic Woodpeckers declining by 42.2% in Conguillío National Park, but increasing by 34.3% in Nahuelbuta National Park. Woodpeckers responded to forest conditions within each park such that their abundance increased with high quality of foraging habitat, i.e., large PSRI values, and the presence of old-growth Monkey puzzle (Araucaria araucana) - Nothofagus pumilio mixed forest. Anecdotal evidence suggests that populations of woodpeckers in Conguillío National Park might have responded negatively to large-scale disturbances from recent forest fires affecting part of the forest area within park. Because stochastic events seemed to strongly mediate population changes, our findings suggest that regional conservation of Magellanic Woodpeckers requires expanding the current conservation area network in central-southern Chile. © 2017 by the author(s).","Campephilus magellanicus; National parks; Population changes",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039911272

Prescribed fire and herbicide application are 2 common methods of LLP restoration. We employed a multi-scale approach to investigate how occurrence of fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) was influenced by fire frequency and herbicide application in LLP communities of northern Florida. We sampled 9-point, 4-ha grids of camera traps with 106 grids in fire treatments, 23 herbicide treatment grids, and 27 control grids. We evaluated a priori models for occurrence of fox squirrels at point, 4-ha patch, and home-range scales, and the influence of fire and herbicides on vegetation structure. Fox squirrel occurrence was positively associated with densities of turkey oak (Quercus laevis) at the patch scale, which were significantly less abundant in herbicide-treated areas. Fox squirrel occurrence was negatively correlated with fire interval and positively correlated with oak densities at a localized point scale. Additionally, fox squirrel point occurrences declined over time since the last fire. Fire produced habitat more favorable for fox squirrels than did herbicide treatments. © 2017 American Society of Mammalogists.","Florida; herbicide; occupancy; Pinus palustris; prescribed fire; Quercus laevis restoration; Sciurus niger",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85039174217

As a result, forest restoration is increasingly implemented to counteract the negative effects. However, restoration measures aimed at mimicking natural disturbance regimes could simultaneously increase the risk of unwanted negative effects, such as damage by forest pest species. This study compares the effect of two restoration methods (prescribed burning and gap-cutting), on both biodiversity conservation and pest control, to provide a basis for solutions to this potential conflict. Bark beetles are ideal for studying this conflict, as this group is both species-rich and contains notorious pest species. We conducted a unique, large-scale field experiment in which we compared the effect of two different restoration methods on the abundance, species richness and assemblage composition of bark beetles. In addition, we estimated uncontrolled tree mortality by the number of trees that died post-restoration. Beetles were divided in two groups, primary and secondary, the former with an ability to kill growing trees. Bark beetle diversity did not differ between treatment groups prior to restoration. However, after restoration, assemblage composition and primary bark beetle abundance differed between the treatments. Furthermore, species richness was higher in burned and gap-cut stands compared to reference stands. The number of trees that died post-restoration was highest on burned sites, whereas no difference was found between gap-cut and reference stands. The number of dead trees was correlated with the number of primary beetles. Synthesis and applications. We demonstrate the potential for a conflict between forest restoration for biodiversity conservation and the potential risk for tree mortality caused by forest pests. This is likely to become a problem in many boreal forests; however, our results suggest that this conflict can be moderated by the choice of restoration method. The restoration method gap-cutting had a similar positive impact on bark beetle species richness as compared to the burning method, but did not as burning, increase tree mortality. Thus, in areas where there is an apparent risk for pest outbreaks, our data suggest that gap-cutting should be the chosen method to avoid an unwanted increase in tree mortality at the stand level. © 2017 The Authors.

There is increasing evidence that biodiversity contributes to forest ecosystem functioning and the provision of ecosystem services. Here we provide a review of forest ecosystem services including biomass production, habitat provisioning services, pollination, seed dispersal, resistance to wind storms, fire regulation and mitigation, pest regulation of native and invading insects, carbon sequestration, and cultural ecosystem services, in relation to forest type, structure and diversity. We also consider relationships between forest biodiversity and multifunctionality, and trade-offs among ecosystem services. We compare the concepts of ecosystem processes, functions and services to clarify their definitions. Our review of published studies indicates a lack of empirical studies that establish quantitative and causal relationships between forest biodiversity and many important ecosystem services. The literature is highly skewed; studies on provisioning of nutrition and energy, and on cultural services, delivered by mixed-species forests are under-represented. Planted forests offer ample opportunity for optimising their composition and diversity because replanting after harvesting is a recurring process.

There are several potential ecological benefits to frequent fires, such as suppression of encroaching fire-intolerant plant species, increased reproductive allocations of native herbaceous plant species, and increased plant diversity at the stand level. However, recent literature has reported a decline in frugivorous wildlife species in frequently burned landscapes, raising concern for fire-regime effects on fruit production. Thus, an assessment of the effects fire frequency on fleshy fruit abundance is needed. In a replicated field experiment following 4 or more rotations of a 1-yr, 2-yr, and 3-yr fire-return interval, we measured fruit production each month of the growing season (i.e., May-September) in the critically threatened longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem – an ecosystem where frequent fire intervals commonly are recommended. Compared to the 3-yr fire-return interval, cumulative understory fruit production was 99% less following a 1-yr or 2-yr fire-return interval. In fact, all of the fruit detected in 1-yr and 2-yr treatments were detected in patches of vegetation unburned by the previous fire. Additionally, no fruits were detected on any transect in the midstory and overstory strata. These results suggest that applying fire on <3-yr fire-return intervals across large land areas could have negative effects on soft mast-dependent wildlife species. Moreover, without a mosaic in fire-spread, even a 3-yr fire return interval may eliminate midstory and overstory fleshy fruit production over time. We recommend fire managers incorporate multiple fire-return intervals and firing techniques to capture the ecological benefits of variability in frequency and spatial extents in fire. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Fire-return interval; Frugivore; Longleaf pine; Prescribed fire; Pyrodiversity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029545936

Less developed is the use of these spatial tools for planning, implementing, and evaluating ecosystem restoration projects and especially so in multifunctional landscapes. We use a case study approach in a multistakeholder tropical dryland restoration project to highlight the potential of remotely sensed products to quantitatively and economically guide often conflicting restoration priorities with stakeholder objectives. High-resolution digital elevation models derived from an airborne remote sensing platform informed land managers tasked with endangered species restoration by guiding their efforts to highly suitable areas of the landscape where plant growth, performance, and survival should be greater. In turn, satellite-based monitoring offered a temporal approach to broadly quantify vegetation fire risk in order to restrict fire promoting activities in dry landscapes most modified by fire promoting invasive grasses. Together, the delineation of high suitability areas for plant-based restoration and low suitability areas for wildfire management ultimately releases moderate suitability land for alternative land uses deemed important in multistakeholder landscapes.

Shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata) is threatened by a variety of stresses, including diseases, pests, poor management, altered fire regimes, and climate change, and the species is the subject of a widescale restoration effort. Surface mines may present opportunity for shortleaf pine restoration; however, the survival and growth of shortleaf pine on these harsh sites has not been critically evaluated. This paper presents first-year survival and growth of native shortleaf pine planted on a reclaimed surface mine, compared to non-native loblolly pine (Pinus taeda), which has been highly successful in previous mined land reclamation plantings. Pine monoculture plots are also compared to pine-hardwood polyculture plots to evaluate effects of planting mix on tree growth and survival, as well as soil health. Initial survival of shortleaf pine is low (42%), but height growth is similar to that of loblolly pine. No differences in survival or growth were observed between monoculture and polyculture treatments. Additional surveys in coming years will address longer-term growth and survival patterns of these species, as well as changes to relevant soil health endpoints, such as soil carbon. © 2017 by the authors.","Appalachia; Loblolly pine; Mine reclamation; Reforestation; Restoration ecology; Shortleaf pine",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030530630

Most restoration methods in this environment aim to emulate natural disturbances, and thereby promote the development of key ecological structures. However, research about forest ecosystem restoration is still in its infancy and the responses of many boreal species groups remain to be described. We established a large-scale field experiment to evaluate the short-term effects of two restoration treatments – prescribed burning and gap cutting involving the creation of dead wood – on breeding bird assemblages in boreal Sweden. We censused breeding birds using territory mapping during two years in forest stands subjected to the two restoration treatments, in untreated controls and in old-growth references (nature reserves) (n = 10 per treatment). Averaged over the two census years, we found 1145 territories of 36 bird species. Total bird species richness and abundance did not differ among treatments. However, prescribed burning led to clear changes in the structure of the bird assemblages. When dividing species according to four functional categorizations (migration, foraging, nesting and successional stage), we found that the abundance of long-distance migrants, ground breeders, strong cavity excavators and species preferring early-successional habitat was higher in burned stands than in untreated controls and gap-cut stands, as was the species richness of bark feeders and strong cavity excavators. In contrast, abundance of off-ground breeders and species richness of crown feeders were lower following prescribed burning than in the controls. The gap cutting treatment did not have any significant effects on the bird assemblages. Ecological restoration through prescribed burning can be a useful tool for the conservation of boreal forest birds, including the ecologically important strong cavity excavators (i.e. woodpeckers (Picidae)). Forest managers should therefore be encouraged to use prescribed burning as a restoration tool to quickly provide habitat for bird species adapted to natural disturbances in boreal forest. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Bird assemblages; Ecological restoration; Field experiment; Gap cutting; Prescribed burning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021986965

(longleaf pine) ecosystems support a diversity of rare plants and animals, but have been substantially degraded by historical human impacts. A suite of natural disturbances influence development and succession in P. palustris ecosystems, ranging from frequent, low-intensity events such as surface fires to infrequent, catastrophic events such as hurricanes. Like hurricanes, tornadoes may produce catastrophic winds that create canopy openings necessary for regeneration of P. palustris and other shade-intolerant species. Despite their pervasiveness in some P. palustris ecosystems, we know relatively little about the impacts of tornadoes. Our study, conducted July-August 2015 in fire-restored P. palustris stands of the Alabama Fall Line Hills, applied a nested sampling design to compare dead trees, live trees, saplings, seedlings, and herbaceous plants in plots either undisturbed or directly impacted by an Enhanced Fujita scale 3 tornado on April 27, 2011. Most wind-killed trees were uprooted or snapped, and consisted primarily of large P. palustris stems. Pinus palustris persisted, however, with increased relative densities in the tree, sapling, and seedling strata of wind-disturbed neighborhoods. The relative densities of Quercus L. (oak) trees and saplings also increased. Combined with an herbaceous stratum composition typical of other restored P. palustris stands, desirable woody species recovery indicated that the stands surveyed here were resilient to the 2011 tornado. Contrary to expectations, the tornado reduced woody stem diversity and herbaceous cover. These results may serve as a benchmark for tracking species-specific changes in P. palustris communities and guide management decisions, including those designed to promote native forest diversity. © 2017 by The Torrey Botanical Society.","Alabama; Fall Line Hills; Pinus palustris longleaf pine; Tornado; Wind disturbance",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029528197

Restoration of these ecosystems to their savanna condition is seen as a way to reduce woody species encroachment and dangerous fuel loads, and restore community species composition. The management practices to achieve these goals typically involve thinning and prescribed fire. We assessed how thinning to reduce basal area combined with frequent prescribed fire influenced small mammal communities and their habitat. We focused on six habitat variables that can influence small mammal abundance and species composition: stand basal area of live trees and snags, volume of coarse woody debris, percent ground cover, forest floor depth, and distance of vulnerability, a measure of understory vegetation structure and animal vulnerability to predators. Although savanna restoration reduced basal area by 80%, there was no change in snag density or coarse woody debris volume. Savanna restoration significantly increased the ground cover of graminoids, forbs, bare ground, and down woody debris and reduced forest floor depth and distance of vulnerability. These habitat changes likely contributed to the significant differences between small mammal communities in restored and non-restored stands. Restoration treatments caused a large increase in abundance of White-footed Mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and important changes in community assemblages.

We used MaxEnt to develop a regional-scale model for the koala Phascolarctos cinereus at a resolution (250 m) that could be used to guide management. To ensure the model was fit for purpose, we placed emphasis on validating the model using independently-collected field data. We reduced substantial spatial clustering of records in coastal urban areas using a 2-km spatial filter and by modeling separately two subregions separated by the 500-m elevational contour. A bias file was prepared that accounted for variable survey effort. Frequency of wildfire, soil type, floristics and elevation had the highest relative contribution to the model, while a number of other variables made minor contributions. The model was effective in discriminating different habitat suitability classes when compared with koala records not used in modeling. We validated the MaxEnt model at 65 ground-truth sites using independent data on koala occupancy (acoustic sampling) and habitat quality (browse tree availability). Koala bellows (n = 276) were analyzed in an occupancy modeling framework, while site habitat quality was indexed based on browse trees. Field validation demonstrated a linear increase in koala occupancy with higher modeled habitat suitability at ground-truth sites. Similarly, a site habitat quality index at ground-truth sites was correlated positively with modeled habitat suitability. The MaxEnt model provided a better fit to estimated koala occupancy than the site-based habitat quality index, probably because many variables were considered simultaneously by the model rather than just browse species. The positive relationship of the model with both site occupancy and habitat quality indicates that the model is fit for application at relevant management scales. Field-validated models of similar resolution would assist in guiding management of conservation-dependent species. © 2017 The Authors.

However, it is unclear how fires applied just prior to and during the reproductive cycle of ground nesting Galliformes influence resource selection. We examined the short-term influence of prescribed fire on habitat selection of female eastern wild turkeys (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) throughout their reproductive cycle (Feb−Aug) at Kisatchie National Forest in west-central Louisiana, USA during 2014 and 2015. Kisatchie was dominated (>60%) by pine stands managed with prescribed fire at a frequent (i.e., 1–3 yr) return interval. We captured 46 females and equipped them with backpack-style global positioning system (GPS) transmitters programmed to collect relocation data hourly from 0600 to 2000 each day. We used distance-based analysis to estimate selection or avoidance of vegetation communities relative to reproductive phenology of individual females. Hardwood and mixed-pine hardwood vegetation communities were selected for before and after reproductive efforts; hardwood stands were avoided during brooding. While laying their first clutch of the reproductive period, females selected mature pines burned 0–5 months prior. Females avoided mature pine stands 2 growing seasons post-burn prior to initiating their first nests. Females avoided mature pine stands 3 growing seasons post-burn when brooding. Turkeys did not select for pine stands that had experienced ≥3 growing seasons post-burn during any reproductive period, and may avoid these stands during pre-nesting and brooding. Frequent fire return intervals maintain vegetation communities that females select at some point during the reproductive season in pine-dominated landscapes. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017","brownian bridge movement model; distance-based habitat selection; Louisiana; Meleagris gallopavo; nesting; prescribed fire; reproduction; resource selection; space use",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019483958

Most empirical studies on the effects of disturbance track population recovery within habitat patches, but have an incomplete representation of the recolonization process. In addition, recent metapopulation models represent post-disturbance colonization with a recovery state or time-lag for disturbed (“focal”) patches, thus assuming that recolonization rates are uniform. However, the availability of colonists in neighbouring “source” patches can vary, especially in frequently disturbed landscapes such as fire-managed forests that have a mosaic of patches that differ in successional state and undergo frequent local extinctions. To determine how time since disturbance in both focal and neighbouring source patches might affect metapopulations, we studied the effects of time since fire (TSF) on abundances of a specialist palmetto beetle within and between fire management units in Apalachicola National Forest, Florida. We measured beetle abundances at three distances from the shared edge of paired units, with units ranging from 0 to 64 months since fire and the difference in time since burning for a focal-source pair ranging from 3 to 58 months. Soon after fire, beetle abundances within management units were highest near the unit edge, but this pattern changed with increasing TSF. Between paired units, the more recently disturbed (“focal”) unit's beetle abundance was positively related to source unit abundance, but the shape of this relationship differed based on focal unit TSF and the units’ difference in time since burning. Results suggest that both focal and source habitat history can influence recolonization of recently disturbed patches and that these effects may persist over years.

Populations at the periphery of their range have exhibited some of the steepest declines, and these sparrows are now rare or extirpated over much of the northern extent of their historical range. To better understand the spatial ecology of Bachman's Sparrows in this region of decline, we examined microhabitat selection and determined the home range sizes of radio-tagged male Bachman's Sparrows (N = 37) in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina in 2014 and 2015. From April to July, we located males 1–2 times daily for 5–6 d per week. We measured vegetation structure in home ranges using 5-m-radius plots centered on a subset of 10 randomly selected telemetry locations as well as in available unused locations 50 m and in a random direction from each telemetry location. Mean size of home ranges (7.9 ha) was larger than estimates reported in most previous studies, with differences among studies possibly due, at least in part, to differences in the characteristics of habitats where studies were conducted. The home ranges of Bachman's Sparrows in our study had greater densities of woody and dead vegetation than unused areas. Although generally considered detrimental to the presence of Bachman's Sparrows, the presence of some woody vegetation in frequently burned (i.e., ≤ 3-yr return interval) longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) communities like those in our study may be important in providing song perches for males and cover from attacking predators. Bachman's Sparrows in our study showed clear selection for several vegetation characteristics linked to frequent fire. Management strategies that approximate historical fire regimes in longleaf pine ecosystems should continue to be promoted as essential tools for the conservation of Bachman's Sparrows. © 2017 Association of Field Ornithologists","kernel density estimators; longleaf pine; minimum convex polygon; radio-telemetry",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029623483

The Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis), a species closely associated with fire-maintained longleaf pine communities, is listed as a species of conservation concern across its entire range. Bachman's Sparrow breeding biology may provide valuable insights into population declines and inform restoration and management of remnant longleaf pine forest, but the species' secretive nesting habits have received little attention. We located 132 Bachman's Sparrow nests in the Coastal Plain and Sandhills physiographic regions of North Carolina, USA, during 2014-2015, and modeled nest-site selection and nest survival as a function of vegetation characteristics, burn history, temporal factors, and landscapelevel habitat amount. There were distinct differences in nest-site selection between regions, with Bachman's Sparrows in the Coastal Plain region selecting greater woody vegetation density and lower grass density at nest sites than at non-nest locations. In contrast, sparrows selected nest sites with intermediate grass density and higher tree basal area in the Sandhills region. Despite clear patterns of nest-site selection, we detected no predictors of nest survival in the Sandhills, and nest survival varied only with date in the Coastal Plain. Daily survival rates were similar between regions, and were consistent with published studies from the species' core range where declines are less severe. Overall, our results indicate that creating and maintaining community-specific vegetation characteristics through the application of frequent prescribed fire should increase the amount of nesting cover for Bachman's Sparrows. © 2017 American Ornithological Society.","Bachman's Sparrow; Fire; Landscape; Longleaf pine; Nest survival; Nest-site selection; Peucaea aestivalis; Physiographic region",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020102744

In this review, we provide new insights into the ecology, function, evolution and management of large old trees through broad cross-disciplinary perspectives from literatures in plant physiology, growth and development, evolution, habitat value for fauna and flora, and conservation management. Our review reveals that the diameter, height and longevity of large old trees varies greatly on an inter-specific basis, thereby creating serious challenges in defining large old trees and demanding an ecosystem- and species-specific definition that will only rarely be readily transferable to other species or ecosystems. Such variation is also manifested by marked inter-specific differences in the key attributes of large old trees (beyond diameter and height) such as the extent of buttressing, canopy architecture, the extent of bark micro-environments and the prevalence of cavities. We found that large old trees play an extraordinary range of critical ecological roles including in hydrological regimes, nutrient cycles and numerous ecosystem processes. Large old trees strongly influence the spatial and temporal distribution and abundance of individuals of the same species and populations of numerous other plant and animal species. We suggest many key characteristics of large old trees such as extreme height, prolonged lifespans, and the presence of cavities – which confer competitive and evolutionary advantages in undisturbed environments – can render such trees highly susceptible to a range of human influences. Large old trees are vulnerable to threats ranging from droughts, fire, pests and pathogens, to logging, land clearing, landscape fragmentation and climate change. Tackling such diverse threats is challenging because they often interact and manifest in different ways in different ecosystems, demanding targeted species- or ecosystem-specific responses. We argue that novel management actions will often be required to protect existing large old trees and ensure the recruitment of new cohorts of such trees. For example, fine-scale tree-level conservation such as buffering individual stems will be required in many environments such as in agricultural areas and urban environments. Landscape-level approaches like protecting places where large old trees are most likely to occur will be needed. However, this brings challenges associated with likely changes in tree distributions associated with climate change, because long-lived trees may presently exist in places unsuitable for the development of new cohorts of the same species. Appropriate future environmental domains for a species could exist in new locations where it has never previously occurred. The future distribution and persistence of large old trees may require controversial responses including assisted migration via seed or seedling establishment in new locales. However, the effectiveness of such approaches may be limited where key ecological features of large old trees (such as cavity presence) depend on other species such as termites, fungi and bacteria. Unless other species with similar ecological roles are present to fulfil these functions, these taxa might need to be moved concurrently with the target tree species. © 2016 Cambridge Philosophical Society","defining large old trees; ecological functions; forest management; giant trees; hollow-bearing trees; snags; threatening processes; tree protection",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978229442

The selection of indicator species often relies on species co-occurrence patterns, which may be altered by anthropogenic disturbance such as forest harvesting, imposing a unique challenge to their application in managed forest. Here, we studied boreal bird communities in natural forests originating from wildfire and managed forests originating from clearcutting. We aimed to (1) compare species co-occurrence patterns in natural and clearcut forest stands, (2) select indicator species based on species co-occurrence patterns to predict avian diversity, and (3) evaluate the predictive performance of indicator species under both natural and clearcutting disturbance regimes using the same training data set and an independent testing data set. We found that species co-occurrence patterns differ substantially between natural and clearcut stands, suggesting that forest harvesting alters species-environment relationships and/or interspecific interactions. Consequently, we selected different sets of species as indicators of avian diversity based on data from natural or clearcut stands. However, according to internal and external evaluation, selecting indicator species using data from both natural and clearcut stands produced surrogates that predicted avian diversity accurately and precisely in both types of forests. Our results suggest that, despite forest harvesting altering species co-occurrence patterns, a comprehensive understanding of species co-occurrence patterns across natural and managed forests can be used to develop robust biodiversity surrogates. Our study shows that small sets of indicator species can represent the biodiversity of a wide range of species in ecosystems undergoing anthropogenic disturbance, which has important implications for the application of biodiversity surrogates for conservation. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity surrogates; Bird diversity; Boreal ecosystem; Coexistence; Disturbance gradient; Environmental filtering",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018785651

Yet, our understanding of the demographic factors behind the adverse effects of fragmentation remains limited for many species. We studied the breeding demographics of the Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis), a species of conservation concern that is associated with highly imperiled longleaf pine ecosystems in the southeastern United States. We quantified the effects of local- and landscape-scale factors on different components of reproductive success (i.e., pairing success and probability of fledging offspring) for 96 male sparrows at eight sites in southeastern North Carolina. Pairing success of monitored sparrows was 69%, and 77% of paired males fledged ≥1 offspring. Habitat amount in the surrounding landscape, rather than local habitat quality, was the most influential predictor of pairing success for male Bachman's Sparrows. In contrast, we documented no predictors of successfully fledging offspring for paired males. We infer that reduced pairing success is limiting reproduction in isolated landscapes and may be a contributing factor for the low occupancy and declines of Bachman's Sparrow in our study region. Overall, our results suggest that managers can promote breeding opportunities for Bachman's Sparrows by prioritizing resources to patches near large, preexisting longleaf pine forest to ensure ≥20% habitat within the surrounding landscape. © 2017 Winiarski et al.","Bachman's Sparrow; Dispersal; Fire; Fragmentation; Habitat amount; Landscape; Longleaf pine; North Carolina; Pairing success; Reproductive success",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026913720

Both models had good accuracy (test AUC &gt; 0.8 and True Skill Statistic &gt; 0.4), and high overlap between suitability scores (I statistic 0.786) and suitable habitat patches (relative rank 0.639).

To understand ongoing declines and plan for conservation, researchers need reliable estimates of adult survival and site fidelity. However, variation in adult survival and site fidelity within and among species is substantial and could have consequences for management. Estimates of adult survival are lacking for many bird species and ecoregions, including the Great Plains. In this field study, we used Cormack-Jolly-Seber mark-recapture models to analyze encounter histories of 17 species of birds captured with a 13-year systematic mist-netting effort in northeast Kansas. We estimated annual rates of apparent adult survival (φ) and corrected for the probability of capture (p), and tested for effects of sex and breeding habitat guild. We present the first estimates of apparent survival for six species of songbirds, and the first estimates from the Great Plains for 13 species. Apparent survival tended to be higher for males than for females, and we found a sex effect on the probability of capture for one species. Unexpectedly, grassland- and shrubland-breeding species had higher estimates of apparent survival than forest-breeding species. Our results did not support the prevailing viewpoint that birds breeding in dynamic landscapes, such as frequently burned grasslands, should show lower apparent survival than species that breed in woody habitats. We demonstrate that habitat plays an important role in the survival and site fidelity of songbirds, and that regional differences in habitat structure could drive variation in demography. Understanding the drivers of true survival and site fidelity of songbirds will allow region-specific management for species of conservation concern.","Cormack-Jolly-Seber models; habitat guilds; site fidelity; songbird; tallgrass prairie; woodpecker",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021830051

Understanding how organisms perceive barriers to movement, or landscape resistance, during natal dispersal is important to conserve and manage populations threatened by fragmentation and habitat loss. Objectives: We aimed to (1) model probability of landscape use by an endangered small mammal (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus grahamensis) in the Pinaleño Mountains, Arizona, USA as a function of forest structure at the population and intra-population level, (2) identify potential natal dispersal pathways between natal and settlement locations based on landscape resistance scenarios, and (3) assess which resistance surface best represented observed exploration, dispersal, and settlement. Methods: We modeled probability of habitat use via used and available animal locations. We developed three landscape resistance scenarios to represent individual differences in perceived resistance. We used circuit theory to identify potential long-distance dispersal pathways and to assess which resistance scenario best represented observed forest use and settlement. Results: Top probability of forest use models included physical landscape features, forest structure, and burn severity. Composite connectivity models, created from multiple resistance scenarios, identified areas that may promote long distance dispersal movements. Connectivity models developed from only natal focal nodes allowed for assessment of resistance scenarios; a non-linear, negative-exponential relationship between probability of use and resistance best represented observed exploration and settlement. Conclusions: Circuit theory is a useful tool to identify potential small mammal movement pathways when high temporal resolution movement data are limited, and for assessing how well resistance scenarios represent observed settlement patterns. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Arizona; Circuitscape; Pinaleño Mountains; Point selection function; Resistance surface; Small mammal",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018837819

However, fire could alter the abundance and persistence of some arthropods, in turn influencing vertebrate taxa that depend on those arthropods as a food source. We used replicated prescribed fire treatments to evaluate macroarthropod response to time-since-fire in the fire-maintained longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. We sampled macroarthropod assemblages using vinyl gutter pitfall traps for 5 consecutive days in each month of the study (May-August 2014) in each replicate burn block. We identified macroarthropods to Order and dried and weighed the samples to determine biomass (g) of all taxa detected. We focused our analyses on 4 macroarthropod taxa important as food for wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo): Araneae, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Orthoptera. We used standard least squares regression to evaluate the effect of time-since-fire on total biomass of the 4 Orders (and we also evaluated those Orders independently). The analysis indicated that time-since-fire had no effect (p = 0.2616) on combined biomass of these 4 taxa. Analyzing the 4 Orders separately, biomass of Araneae (p = 0.0057) and Orthoptera (p = 0.0004) showed significant effects of time-since-fire, while Coleoptera (p = 0.9465) and Hymenoptera (p = 0.1175) did not. Parameter estimates (Araneae = 0.0084; SE = 0.0029; Orthoptera = 0.0137; SE = 0.0036) indicated that greater time-since-fire resulted in greater biomass for those 2 Orders. Overall, time-since-fire did not appear to have substantial effects on macroarthropod biomass. However, responses by Araneae and Orthoptera provided evidence that longer time-since-fire may result in greatest levels of biomass for some taxa. Our results indicate the use of frequent prescribed fire to restore and maintain longleaf forests is unlikely to pose risks to overall macroarthropod biomass, particularly if heterogeneity in fire frequency and spatial extent occurs on the landscape. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Araneae; Fire-maintained; Invertebrate; Longleaf pine; Orthoptera; Prescribed fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014024785

Today, these woodlands are often in decline as competition from conifers intensifies. Among oak species affected is the ecologically important California black oak (Quercus kelloggii Newberry). Within its range, large high-severity wildfires have become more common. We examined responses of black oak to two mixed-severity wildfires 12 years apart (2000 Storrie Fire and 2012 Chips Fire reburn). Regeneration was examined in relation to fire severity as measured by the Relative differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (RdNBR). We found that the RdNBR of the Storrie Fire was a useful predictor of the RdNBR of the Chips Fire reburn, suggesting that effects of the Storrie Fire on vegetation influenced fire behavior in the Chips reburn (t12 = 2.892, P = 0.014, n = 14, r = 0.641). After experiencing a second top-kill (complete cambium mortality above the root collar) in the Chips reburn, 95% (99 of 104) of black oak sprout clumps resprouted. Twelve years after the Storrie Fire, we found lower proportions of sprout clumps produced acorns in places where more overstory trees survived the fire (t5 = −3.023, P = 0.029, n = 7, r = 0.804). After both fires, the crown volume of entire sprout clumps was lower in areas of higher live overstory tree basal area (Storrie Fire: t5 = 2.527, P = 0.053, n = 7, r = 0.749; Chips reburn: t5 = −3.597, P = 0.016, n = 7, r = 0.849). Our finding that most black oak survived successive top-kill from repeat fire suggested that repeated high-severity or mixed-severity fire is not an immediate threat to black oak presence on the landscape. Our findings also suggest that, if high-severity fire is followed by historically normal fire return intervals, rapidly regenerating black oak may be favored over conifers and recover from decline. © 2017, Association for Fire Ecology.

Problems common to fire scientists and managers worldwide include a limited knowledge of how multiple taxonomic groups within a given ecosystem respond to recurrent fires, and how interactions between fire regimes and environmental gradients influence biodiversity. We tested six hypotheses relating to fire regimes and environmental gradients in forest ecosystems using data on birds (493 sites), mammals (175 sites), and vascular plants (615 sites) systematically collected in dry eucalypt forests in southeastern Australia. We addressed each of these hypotheses by fitting species distribution models which differed in the environmental variables used, the spatial extent of the data, or the type of response data. We found (1) as predicted, fire interacted with environmental gradients and shaped species distributions, but there was substantial variation between species; (2) multiple characteristics of fire regimes influenced the distribution of forest species; (3) common to vertebrates and plants was a strong influence of temperature and rainfall gradients, but contrary to predictions, inter-fire interval was the most influential component of the fire regime on both taxonomic groups; (4) mixed support for the hypothesis that fire would be a stronger influence on species occurrence at a smaller spatial extent; only for vertebrates did scale have an effect in the direction expected; (5) as predicted, vertebrates closely associated with direct measures of habitat structure were those most strongly influenced by fire regimes; and (6) the modeled fire responses for birds were sensitive to the use of either presence-absence or abundance data. These results underscore the important insights that can be gained by modeling how fire regimes, not just fire events, influence biota in forests. Our work highlights the need for management of fire regimes to be complemented by an understanding of the underlying environmental gradients and key elements of habitat structure that influence resource availability for plants and animals. We have demonstrated that there are general patterns in biotic responses to fire regimes and environmental gradients, but landscape management must continue to carefully consider species, scale, and the quality of biodiversity data to achieve biodiversity conservation in fire-prone forests. © 2017 Kelly et al.","Australia; Biodiversity; Birds; Boosted regression trees; Climate; Fire ecology; Forest management; Mammals; Rainfall; Sampling design; Species distribution models; Temperature",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018310254

These tools should integrate multiple components of habitat quality and incorporate local disturbance regimes. We provide a spatial modeling framework that integrates three components of habitat (nutritional resources, connectivity, and predation risk) into indices of habitat quality under a simulated wildfire disturbance regime. Woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), a species of conservation concern, is used to illustrate our framework. We simulated disturbance from wildfire on two boreal forest landscapes to produce stand ages, from which we computed and integrated the three habitat indicator components using different schemes. Spatial variation in the influence of wildfire and the distribution of the three components of habitat resulted in heterogeneous patterns of habitat quality. The inclusion of disturbance led to a different habitat quality landscape than that of a static model in which the influence of wildfire on vegetation communities was not considered, incorporating the likelihood of persistence into the overall representation of habitat quality. The integration of nutrition, connectivity, and predation risk into a single index of habitat quality produced spatial patterns distinct from maps of the individual components. Regardless of whether the components were combined through additive, multiplicative, or minimum habitat quality threshold methods, areas of very high- And poor-quality habitat were found at consistent locations across the landscape, suggesting that these two types of regions provide opportunities for long-term management interventions. The framework presented here is adaptable and modular; it could be modified and applied to other species, regions, and disturbance regimes. It provides a nuanced representation of persistent habitat and has the potential to be a useful tool for conservation planning. © 2017 Whitman et al.","Connectivity; Disturbance modeling; Habitat quality; Landscape nutrition; Predation risk; Woodland caribou",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018343866

Using 18 years of data on a population of northern flickers Colaptes auratus, I tested six hypotheses to explain the propensity to excavate (e) in a landscape which experienced two types of disturbance: pine beetles and wildfires.

Body size and body condition of males and females were not associated with e but rates of excavation declined seasonally, suggesting time rather than energy costs limited excavation effort. Reduced cavity availability mediated through high conspecific density coupled with wildfires triggered relatively high excavation rates, up to 39% but e decreased to baseline levels three years after the landscape disturbances. Nearly 2/3 of males did not excavate in their lifetime but apparently, e is great enough to balance the average rate of cavity tree loss in this forest which is 11% annually.

To better understand the diverse ecological functions of refugia on burn mosaics, we used remotely sensed data to quantify neighborhood patterns of areas relatively unchanged following the 2011 Las Conchas fire. Spatial patterns of refugia measured within 10-ha moving windows varied across a gradient from areas of high density, clustered in space, to sparsely populated neighborhoods that occurred in the background matrix. The scaling of these patterns was related to the underlying structure of topography measured by slope, aspect and potential soil wetness, and spatially varying climate. Using a nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis of species cover data collected post-Las Conchas, we found that trees and forest associates were present across the refugial gradient, but communities also exhibited a range of species compositions and potential functions. Spatial patterns of refugia quantified for three previous burns (La Mesa 1977, Dome 1996, Cerro Grande 2000) were dynamic between fire events, but most refugia persisted through at least two fires.

However, fire exclusion and conversion to Pinus elliottii (slash pine) plantations has provided the conditions for much of the forest to become susceptible to what Lindenmayer et al. (2011) call a ""landscape trap,"" where ecological processes no longer function to maintain the ecosystem. For the longleaf pine-bunchgrass ecosystem, the trap occurs when fire-dependent herbaceous vegetation have been replaced with woody shrubs, and there are no fine fuels that will readily transmit frequent fire. Restoration of slash pine plantations to longleaf pine forest will require continued transmission of fire across the restoration areas. With the cooperation of the US Forest Service, we conducted an experiment to study the effectiveness of thinning and patch clear-cuts in slash pine plantations and compared the burnability of these treatments. Eighty percent of the thinned plots burned, but only 12% of the patch clear-cuts did. These differences resulted from reduced needle cast in the clear-cuts. Plots in which the ground cover was dominated by herbaceous vegetation were significantly more likely to burn (97%) than those dominated by woody vegetation (38%).

Small mammals are an important ecosystem component in many terrestrial communities and depend on ground-level vegetation most commonly affected by prescribed fire. In this complex system of food and cover availability where easier access to food might compromise cover, and vice versa, it is imperative to study postfire habitat use by mice and other ground-dwelling wildlife. We evaluated effects of time since burn and vegetation type on Peromyscus spp. abundance in a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem in Fort Bragg Military Installation, North Carolina, USA, during 2011 and 2012. We trapped in 5 vegetation types and captured 208 individual Peromyscus. Peromyscus abundance did not differ among 1, 2, and 3 years postburn upland pine vegetation types, although we noted a trend of decreasing abundance as time since burn increased; however, abundance was greater in the lowland hardwood vegetation type than in open areas (i.e., military drop zones). The lack of an effect of time since burn could be due to the short fire-return interval at the study site, which limited the time for postburn shifts in the composition of the understory from herbaceous to woody plant species. Therefore, we suggest future research in the longleaf pine ecosystem incorporate a wider time frame to assess short- and long-term effects of fire on small mammal populations. © 2017 The Wildlife Society. © The Wildlife Society, 2017","capture–recapture modeling; lowland hardwood; military installation; mouse; rodent; time since burn; vegetation composition",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016217300

Continuous native oak forests have been converted into heterogeneous landscapes characterized by small forest fragments surrounded by a scrubby matrix. We examined the response of five species of cavity-nesting birds to these phenomena because they play a keystone role in these forest ecosystems. We quantified the relative effects of landscape composition and the configuration of mature oak forest on the occurrence of the focal species. We hypothesized that the occurrence of all focal species would increase with forest cover, whereas the effects of matrix type and mature forest configuration would be species-specific. For each focal species, we tested a set of 12 candidate models predicting their occurrence. Each model included landscape metrics describing oak forest configuration and landscape composition. We applied multimodel inference and model averaging on generalized linear models. Forest cover at the landscape level was the main driver of species occurrence. Secondary cavity-nesters responded positively to the proportion of oak forest at landscape and local scales, whereas the five focal species responded negatively to the proportion of low scrub. Great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major) and Levaillant's woodpecker (Picus vaillantii) responded positively to both forest amount and high scrub, suggesting a landscape complementation process. Lesser spotted woodpecker (D. minor) was the only species responding to forest configuration, possibly as a result of landscape supplementation. High scrub appeared to moderate the contrast between low scrub and forest fragments for primary cavity-nesters. However, it did not influence the occurrence of secondary cavity-nesters (e.g., Atlas flycatcher Ficedula speculgera and short-toed treecreeper Certhia brachydactyla). If an increase in the amount of mature oak forest cannot be achieved over the short term, the maintenance of high scrub around forest fragments and an improvement in the quality of low scrub through the addition of vertical structure should increase the frequency of occurrence of many of our focal species in oak forest of the Mediterranean Basin. © 2016","Forest conservation; Grazing; Habitat fragmentation; Maquis vegetation, Mediterranean Basin; Woodpeckers",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002662401

Despite decades of study, the mechanisms that determine parasite host specificity remain poorly understood. We investigated host specificity in New Zealand’s largest endemic moth, Aenetus virescens (Lepidoptera: Hepialidae), which as larvae excavate tunnels into tree trunks and feed on host tree sap. We sampled host use in 2213 trees belonging to 24 tree species in three sites on the North island of New Zealand to test whether (1) larvae preferentially use particular tree species rather than the most abundant, (2) larvae preferentially use tree species with high nutrient rewards (Phloem turnover and sugar content), and (3) larvae preferentially use tree species with reduced defences (wood density and bark thickness). Overall, 180 individual trees from 15 species were used by larvae. However, results indicated larvae preferentially used particular tree species rather than the most abundant. In particular, larvae preferentially used Aristotelia serrata and Carpodetus serratus, despite being rare at each site. Larvae did not preferentially use tree species with high nutrient rewards nor low wood density. Instead, we found a significant negative relationship between the number of trees per species used by larvae and bark thickness. Overall results indicate bark thickness may be the primary mechanism driving host specificity for A. virescens. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Aenetus virescens; Aristotelia serrata; Host–parasite relationships; Lepidoptera",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007251839

We used a coupled human and natural systems framework and an agent-based landscape model to examine how alternative management scenarios affect fire and ecosystem services metrics in a fire-prone multiownership landscape in the eastern Cascades of Oregon. Our model incorporated existing models of vegetation succession and fire spread and information from original empirical studies of landowner decision making. Our findings indicate that alternative management strategies can have variable effects on landscape outcomes over 50 years for fire, socioeconomic, and ecosystem services metrics. For example, scenarios with federal restoration treatments had slightly less high-severity fire than a scenario without treatment; exposure of homes in the wildland-urban interface to fire was also slightly less with restoration treatments compared to no management. Treatments appeared to be more effective at reducing high-severity fire in years with more fire than in years with less fire. Under the current management scenario, timber production could be maintained for at least 50 years on federal lands. Under an accelerated restoration scenario, timber production fell because of a shortage of areas meeting current stand structure treatment targets. Trade-offs between restoration outcomes (e.g., open forests with large fire-resistant trees) and habitat for species that require dense older forests were evident. For example, the proportional area of nesting habitat for northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) was somewhat less after 50 years under the restoration scenarios than under no management. However, the amount of resilient older forest structure and habitat for white-headed woodpecker (Leuconotopicus albolarvatus) was higher after 50 years under active management. More carbon was stored on this landscape without management than with management, despite the occurrence of high-severity wildfire. Our results and further applications of the model could be used in collaborative settings to facilitate discussion and development of policies and practices for fire-prone landscapes. © 2017 by the author(s).","Adaptation; Ecosystem services; Landscape; Management; Wildfire",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016763847

In these disturbed landscapes, the juxtaposition of multiple habitat types can be especially important to fledglings and young birds, which may leave breeding grounds in human-altered habitat for different habitats nearby that provide increased foraging opportunities, reduced competition, and higher protection from predators. In this study, we evaluated the importance of three habitat types to two life stages of the critically endangered Bahama Oriole (Icterus northropi), a synanthropic songbird endemic to Andros, The Bahamas. First, we determined the avian species composition and relative abundance of I. northropi among three major vegetation types on Andros: Caribbean pine (Pinus caribaea) forest, coppice (broadleaf dry forest), and anthropogenic areas, dominated by nonnative vegetation (farmland and developed land). We then compared the foraging strategies and social interactions of two age classes of adult Bahama Orioles in relation to differential habitat use. Bird surveys late in the Bahama Oriole's breeding season indicated the number of avian species and Bahama Oriole density were highest in coppice. Some bird species occurring in the coppice and pine forest were never observed in agricultural or residential areas, and may be at risk if human disturbance of pine forest and coppice increases, as is occurring at a rapid pace on Andros. During the breeding season, second-year (SY) adult Bahama Orioles foraged in all vegetation types, whereas after-second-year (ASY) adults were observed foraging only in anthropogenic areas, where the species nested largely in introduced coconut palms (Cocos nucifera). Additionally, SY adults foraging in anthropogenic areas were often observed with an ASY adult, suggesting divergent habitat use for younger, unpaired birds. Other aspects of foraging (vegetation features, food-gleaning behavior, and food items) were similar for the two age classes. Older Bahama Orioles exhibited relatively higher rates of social interactions (intraspecific and interspecific pooled) in anthropogenic areas, and won more interaction outcomes compared to younger adults. Our findings concur with those of other studies indicating dry broadleaf forest is vitally important to migrating, wintering, and resident birds, including the critically endangered Bahama Oriole, which appears to depend heavily on this vegetation type during certain life stages. © 2017 Price and Hayes.","Anthropogenic habitat; Caribbean; Delayed plumage maturation; Dry tropical forest; Pine forest; Synanthropic species",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021160922

A number of invertebrate species are associated with wood decay fungi, serve as vectors for fungal pathogens, or are fungivorous (consume fungi) and influence rates of wood decay and nutrient mineralization. In Washington and Oregon, 31 wildlife species among 8 families are fungivores, and at least 14 wildlife species disperse fungi. Down wood can provide nurse substrates for seedlings and beneficial mycorrhizal fungi, refuges from pathogenic soil fungi, sources of nutrients for decay fungi, and substrates supporting overall fungal diversity. Presence, density, distribution, and diversity of fungi are influenced by forest stand management practices, forest age class, and effects of fire. Old forests provide for a suite of rare fungi species. Old legacy trees retained during forest harvest can provide some degree of conservation of beneficial and rare fungi. Fungi can be difficult to detect and monitor; surveying for fungi at various times of the year, for multiple (at least 5) years, and by including hypogeous (belowground) samples, can improve detection rates. Studies are needed in the Pacific Northwest to quantify the amount of down wood-number of pieces, sizes, total biomass, percentage of forest floor cover, and other attributes-necessary for maintaining or restoring fungal biodiversity and viable levels of individual fungi species, especially rare species. © 2017, USDA Forest Service.

Kori : korja 'hearth' is a forgotten word in modern Estonian, which is known from northwestern Läänemaa as well as Hiiumaa. Nikolai Anderson suggested over a hundred years ago that kori belongs together with the Finnish word korju 'bear's (above-ground) winter lair'. Anderson's comparison has been cited by Andrus Saareste as well as, with some hesitation, in Finnish etymological dictionaries. Julius Mägiste did not attempt to explain the word's origin in his Estnisches etymologisches Wörterbuch. Due to both phonetic and semantic considerations, an etymological link between Estonian kori : korja and Finnish korju is impossible. I suggest that kori : korja is a Baltic loan from the word family represented in modern Baltic languages by Lithuanian kùrti (kùria, kúre) 'to heat up, start a fire etc', ùžkura(s) 'oven full of wood; widower', užkurs 'man who has married a widow and moved into her home; man living in his wife's parents' house'. This Baltic word family has equivalents with fire- and hearth-related meanings in other Indo-European languages, e.g. Old Russian 'to start a fire, ignite', Old English here 'fireplace, hearth, small oven' and the stem variant with a final dental consonant heorõ 'hearth, fireplace, home etc'. Kori : korja presumes a Baltic loan base with the stem ia-, ∗kuria-, presumed original meaning 'fire, fireplace'. Melek(as) 'stock pigeon' occurs sporadically in different parts of northern Estonia. This bird name has been seen as onomatopoetically motivated (Andrus Saareste, Mart Mäger, and with hesitation Alo Raun), a view which has been rejected by Julius Mägiste. Another suggestion is that melekas derives from a common Finnic-Mordvin stem, in which -l- may have developed from the affricate ∗c, cf. dialectal Finnish mettinen 'turtle dove', Erzya Mordvin m ece, m eca 'dove' (Y. H. Toivonen, Mikk Tooms), but Mägiste is skeptical of this explanation as well, and sees the word as more likely a contamination of mehikas mehekas 'wood dove' + meltsas 'green woodpecker, wood dove'. I argue that the explanation of the origin of the word melek(as) must take into account the observation of the Lithuanian linguist, who in the 1880s-1890s drew a parallel to the Lithuanian bird name meletà 'Picus viridis, Dryocopus martius, Merops apiaster, Coracias garrulus; chatterbox, sweet-talking person'. Baltic ∗melata ∗meleta is etymologically related to the Balto-Slavic word family ∗mel- 'to rub, grind; chatter': Lithuanian málti 'to grind; speak too much, blather, prattle', dialectal Russian 'grinder; blabbermouth etc', dialectal Belarusian 'lblabbermouth'. Phonetically, there is no reason not to accept the Baltic etymology. The final syllable ∗-ta of the Baltic loan base has been replaced by the very productive affix k(as), which appears in many bird names. (k)rae- in the compound words (k)raejalad, (k)raepuud 'trestle table, stretcher, barrow' derives from the Low German schrage '(transverse) stand (with two pairs of crossed legs) etc' (Udo Uibo). According to older lexicography, Estonian has known the compound words kooljarahe and rahejalg 'bier, coffin base', which are not related to the aforementioned Low German loan base, because in Low German loans in Estonian, word-internal -g- is replaced by the partially voiced medial stop -g-, in some cases also -j-, but never -h-. Mägiste has presumed that rahe(-) is related to the Finnic word family rahi: Courland Livonian ra'i 'chair', dialectal Finnish rahi : rahin 'bench with no backboard; stool etc', Ingrian rahi rähi 'bench, stove-bench etc', North Karelian rahi 'bench'. I propose a Baltic etymology for the word rahi: < Baltic ∗krasia-, cf. Lithuanian kr se 'chair, reclining chair, stool; low footstool; seat', krasià 'sofa-like wooden bench with backboard; (reclining) chair; standing/walking chair for a small child; footrest etc'. This Baltic stem has plausible etymological correspondences only in Eastern and Western Slavic languages, e.g. Russian è 'armchair, reclining chair, backrest in a sleigh'. An analogous substitution, i.e. Finnic h < Baltic ∗s, is e.g. Estonian lahja 'lean, thin', dialectal lahi, laih, Finnic laiha etc < Late Proto-Finnic ∗laiha < Early Proto- Finnnic ∗lajša < Baltic ∗laisa-. Estonian rahe 'hail' has conformed to other nouns ending in e. Rikkuma, in dialects also rikkima, rikma 'to break, ruin, damage, smash, destroy; negatively influence someone; decay, deteriorate; (dialectally) go bad, become spoiled' is a wide-ranging word family found in all Finnic languages: Finnic ∗rikkoi- < Early Proto-Finnnic ∗rikka. A Germanic etymology has been proposed for it (Christfrid Ganander 1787), which is rejected by etymological dictionaries of Finnic languages. Another rejected explanation is that of Lauri Hakulinen, who suggested that it is related to the word family rikka : rikan 'dust, scrap, litter'. I propose a Baltic etymology for this Finnic verb stem, deriving from either 1. Baltic ∗rika-, on the successors of which are Lithuanian rìkti (riñka renka rinksta, rìko) 'to disintegrate, break into pieces, be crushed; to be wrong, confuse, err, act wrongly or imprecisely (e.g. when speaking or enumerating), stumble', aprìkti 'to confuse, mix up, garble; to be wrong, do something wrong etc' or 2. Baltic ∗trika-, the successors of which are Lithuanian trìkti (triñka, trìko) 'to be wrong, make a mistake, stumble, get stuck (when speaking, enumerating, etc), stutter; disintegrate; break, be ruined; to be ruined, go out of order (e.g. health); to prematurely give birth; to go crazy, lose one's mind, rave; to get rabies (of dogs); to get angry; to get confused, puzzled; to engage in mischief, act strangely, impolitely; bother, disturb, annoy etc'. Phonetically, the German and Baltic loan bases are equally plausible, but semantically the Baltic explanation is a better fit. The core meaning of both the Baltic and Finnic word families is 'to do material damage (i.e. break, ruin)', from which (likely independently of one another) the other semantic lines have branched off. © 2017 Eesti Teaduste Akadeemia, Emakeele Selts.

In this paper we develop an index of stand structural complexity and show how anthropogenic disturbances, namely fire, logging, livestock, and their combined presence, affect stand structural complexity in a southern Global Biodiversity Hotspot. From 2011 to 2013, we measured forest structural attributes as well as the presence of anthropogenic disturbances in 505 plots in the Andean zone of the La Araucanía Region, Chile. In each plot, understory density, coarse woody debris, number of snags, tree diameter at breast height, and litter depth were measured, along with signs of the presence of anthropogenic disturbances. Ninety-five percent of the plots showed signs of anthropogenic disturbance (N = 475), with the combined presence of fire, logging, and livestock being the most common disturbance (N = 222; 44% of plots). The lowest values for the index were measured in plots combining fire, logging, and livestock. Undisturbed plots and plots with the presence of relatively old fires (&gt; 70 years) showed the highest values for the index of stand structural complexity. Our results suggest that secondary forests &lt; 70- year post-fire event, with the presence of habitat legacies (e.g. snags and CWD), can reach a structural complexity as high as undisturbed plots. Temperate forests should be managed to retain structural attributes, including understory density (7.2 ± 2.5 # contacts), volume of CWD (22.4 ± 25.8 m3/ha), snag density (94.4 ± 71.0 stems/ha), stand basal area (61.2 ± 31.4 m2/ha), and litter depth (7.5 ± 2.7 cm). Achieving these values will increase forest structural complexity, likely benefiting a range of faunal species in South American temperate forests. © 2017 Caviedes, Ibarra.

We used a 54-year-old density management experiment in Larix occidentalis Nutt. forests to evaluate density dependence of woody detritus accumulation. Based on self-thinning theory, we expected woody detritus produced by the current stand to increase with stand density. Density-dependent woody detritus accumulation was apparent for fine woody debris and snags and for all woody detritus pools combined. Clear size–density relationships were apparent for coarse woody debris (CWD) and snags; mean piece size decreased with increasing stand density. Legacy CWD that originated from the preharvest old-growth stands accounted for about 45% of total woody detritus biomass. Live trees were largest in the low-density thinning treatments. Greater woody detritus biomass in the high-density and unthinned treatments originates primarily from past self-thinning, with additional inputs from density-dependent top breakage due to snow and ice and branch self-pruning. Because our results were driven by self-thinning mortality, the general trend of increasing woody detritus accumulation with increasing stand density should hold for maturing even-aged stands in other cool temperate and boreal forests. © 2017, Canadian Science Publishing.

Here, we develop and test a conceptual model for how predictability of fire refugia varies according to topographic complexity and fire weather conditions. Refugia were quantified as areas unburned or burned at comparatively low severity based on remotely sensed burn severity data. We assessed the relationship between refugia and a suite of terrain-related explanatory metrics by fitting a collection of boosted regression tree models. The models were developed for seven study fires that burned in conifer-dominated forested landscapes of the Western Cordillera of Canada between 2001 and 2014. We fit nine models, each for distinct levels of fire weather and terrain ruggedness. Our framework revealed that the predictability and abundance of fire refugia varied among these environmental settings. We observed highest predictability under moderate fire weather conditions and moderate terrain ruggedness (ROC-AUC = 0.77), and lowest predictability in flatter landscapes and under high fire weather conditions (ROC-AUC = 0.63-0.68). Catchment slope, local aspect, relative position, topographic wetness, topographic convergence, and local slope all contributed to discriminating where refugia occur but the relative importance of these topographic controls differed among environments. Our framework allows us to characterize the predictability of contemporary fire refugia across multiple environmental settings and provides important insights for ecosystem resilience, wildfire management, conservation planning, and climate change adaptation. © 2016 Krawchuk et al.","Burn mosaic; Burn severity; Fire refugia; Fire weather; Island; Predictability; Remnant; Topo-refugia; Topography; Unburned; Wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008488019

We used carbon isotopic tracer and paired-sampling approaches to examine these assumptions.

Habitat suitability models for nesting woodpeckers can be informative, but tests of model transferability are needed to understand how broadly models developed at one location can be applied to inform post-fire forest management at other locations. We developed habitat suitability models and tested their transferability for 2 disturbance-associated woodpecker species, Black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and Lewis's (Melanerpes lewis) woodpecker. Habitat suitability models consisted of weighted logistic regression models comparing environmental conditions at nest versus non-nest sites. We developed models at each of 3 wildfire locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, and then examined predictive performance for each model at alternate (""application"") locations. Models generally discriminated nest from non-nest sites well at locations where they were developed but performance was variable at application locations, indicating limited transferability. Models for Black-backed Woodpecker and those that included field-collected environmental covariates exhibited greater transferability than models for Lewis's Woodpecker and those that only included remotely sensed covariates. Transferability was also generally poor between Oregon and the other 2 locations. Limitations to model transferability observed in this study suggest models developed at any one wildfire location are unlikely to be generally applicable across the entire range of Black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers. Generally applicable models to inform post-fire forest management will therefore likely require integration of data from multiple wildfire locations. © 2016 Cooper Ornithological Society.","Black-backed Woodpecker; Breeding habitat; Disturbance-associated woodpeckers; Forest management; Habitat suitability model; Lewis's Woodpecker; Melanerpes lewis; Model transferability; Picoides arcticus; Predictive performance; Salvage logging; Wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992317272

The composite fire chronology spanned 1756-2013 with 132 individual scars representing 89 separate fire events. The mean fire interval was 2.9 yr, and mean intervals were significantly different between identified time periods (e.g., settlement period vs. management period). Evidence of biannual fire activity (up to three fires occurring within a 12- to 15-month period) was found coeval with a peak in livestock grazing and logging from the 1850s through the 1880s. Connections were also found between historical fire and Pacific climate variability (e.g., El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Pacific Decadal Oscillation; P < 0.05), yet the fire-climate linkage was likely at least partially masked by substantial human land use activities over the past several centuries. Coupled climate and human land use activity controlled the historical fire regime over the past ca. 240 yr. Although the many fire adaptions of P. palustris yield limitations in tree-ringbased fire history studies (e.g., thick bark), we highlight the efficacy of considering the height at which fire scars are analyzed along the bole as a way to glean a more accurate depiction of historical fire occurrence, especially in ecosystems characterized by a frequent, low-severity fire regime. This study suggests growing-season fire prescribed at a 2- to 3-yr interval would be the first step toward simulating historical landscape conditions and fire activity, should that be the goal by land managers. © 2016 White and Harley.","Dendrochronology; Disturbance ecology; El Niño-Southern Oscillation; Fire history; Gulf Coast; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; Piney Woods; Wildfire",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84995482350

We test whether pyrodiversity—defined as the standard deviation of fire severity—increases avian biodiversity at two spatial scales, and whether and how this relationship may change in the decade following fire. We use a dynamic Bayesian community model applied to a multi-year dataset of bird surveys at 1106 points sampled across 97 fires in montane California. Our results provide strong support for a positive relationship between pyrodiversity and bird diversity. This relationship interacts with time since fire, with pyrodiversity having a greater effect on biodiversity at 10 years post-fire than at 1 year post-fire. Immediately after fires, patches of differing burn severities hold similar bird communities, but over the ensuing decade, bird assemblages within patches of contrasting severities differentiate. When evaluated at the scale of individual fires, fires with a greater heterogeneity of burn severities hold substantially more species. High spatial heterogeneity in severity, sometimes called ‘mixed-severity fire’, is a natural part of wildfire regimes in western North America, but may be jeopardized by climate change and a legacy of fire suppression.

For example, parasite load and immune system status can be inferred through plumage color intensity, and can influence the choice of sexual partners. Here, we evaluated two plumage ornaments in the Yellow-billed Cardinal [Paroaria capitata (d’Orbigny & Lafresnaye 1837)]: the carotenoid-based coloration of the cap and the melanin-based coloration of the bib. We evaluated whether these ornaments were related to blood parasite burden, immunological status and body condition, and whether they could reveal individual sex and age. Cardinals were mist-netted in a Brazilian wetland, and 12 individuals were infected with malaria parasites. Both carotenoid and melanin colorations were related to age, but only carotenoids reflected immunological status. Adult cardinals presented redder caps and darker bibs in comparison to juveniles, and redder caps were associated with low values of heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (H/L, indicating lower stress level). Plumage coloration did not indicate individual sex or parasite infection.

The aims of this study were to (1) uncover the ant diversity and functional groups of Cypress-Tupelo swamps; (2) examine the differences of ant assemblages across vertical strata within trees and across tree species within swamps; and (3) determine if the ant mosaic hypothesis applies to observed patterns of arboreal ant distribution. Pitfall traps were set in tree crowns and on trunks to collect the arboreal ants in three swamps in Louisiana. A total of 21 species from 11 genera were collected. Contrary to our hypothesis, ant diversity on trunks was higher than that in the canopy. A multivariate analysis revealed that the canopy and trunk support distinct ant assemblages, whereas ant species composition was not consistently different among the three dominant tree species- bald cypress, water tupelo, and red maples. In addition, evidence of ant mosaic distribution patterns were not detected. Moreover, we did not find dramatic changes of ant diversity or community structure in trees that were infested with invasive red imported fire ants.

The purpose of this study was to model and map Lewis's woodpecker nesting habitat using primary (directly derived) and secondary (modeled using ground calibration data) remote sensing products, as well as contribute to the knowledge of nesting ecology for the species in a source habitat type. We found promise in the utility of lidar and Landsat time series modeled snag and shrub products in conjunction with additional lidar structure and topographic metrics for predicting nesting habitat for the Lewis's woodpecker across a post-fire landscape. Our selected model had a percent correctly classified rate of 83.3% and contained additional variables (variability in canopy cover and topographic slope) to those included in the Fish and Wildlife Service habitat suitability model (HSM) for the species (canopy cover, shrub cover, and density of large snags). We were able to apply the remote sensing products to map realized habitat relationships for this species of conservation concern in an identified source habitat type, providing a potential resource for local scale conservation and management efforts and adding to the regional knowledge of habitat selection for the Lewis's woodpecker. © 2016 by the Northwest Scientific Association.

Indeed, a large diversity of burn-associated saproxylic beetles use recently burned trees. This study intends to reduce potential impacts of salvage logging on biodiversity by identifying high conservation value forests (HCVFs) for burn-associated beetles, which are considered the most at risk. In five burns ignited naturally in 2010 in the eastern Canadian boreal forest, we selected 31 and 29 stands of black spruce and jack pine respectively. Three 50-cm bole segments were retrieved from each stand and placed in emergence cages to measure tree utilisation by saproxylic beetles. This yielded 7235 beetles from 103 taxa, of which 67 were considered rare (<5% occurrence in logs) and 36 as common taxa (>5% occurrence in logs). Among the common taxa, we identified six groups of ecologically related species using co-occurrence-based hierarchical clustering, among which three were mainly formed by opportunistic species that are currently of little concern in a post-fire logging context. The three other groups were formed by burn-associated species that could be affected by salvage logging. HCVFs include jack pine stands and large trees of either tree species of low- to mid-range burn severity. We also recommend retaining the periphery of burned stands, as ecotones are rich habitats used by several burn-associated species that are found in low numbers in green forests but they benefit from burned habitats by increasing their populations significantly. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada 2016","Acmaeops pratensis; biodiversity; burn severity; Canada; co-occurrence; deadwood; emergence cages; null model analysis; species-habitat association; wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84977137704

The plots established by these two men from 1985 through 1994 were subjected to the most intense MPB stress to occur since 1900 in the Black Hills. The differentiation of western bark beetle species is discussed and how the final species designations of MPBs and western pine beetles (WPB) came about. The life cycle of MPBs is described and how it was used to develop direct control strategies. Bark beetles carry from tree to tree with them a suite of mites, fungi, nematodes, bacteria, and other organisms that can be both antagonistic and beneficial to the bark beetle and several of these contribute to the death of the tree. The direct control efforts of peeling, burning, harvesting, and spraying trees with chemicals to kill WPBs and MPBs are described. Both Crater Lake and the Black Hills experiences to directly control MPBs are discussed. The millions of dollars that were spent to directly control both species of bark beetles were futile and indirect methods of tree and stand treatments were tried. In the Black Hills, Schmid and Mata established 46 MPB study plots, of which 39 were useable, beginning in 1985 with tree densities ranging from 44 feet2 of basal area per acre to 199 feet2 per acre. MPB-caused tree mortality commenced on some of the plots in 1985 and maximum tree densities occurring on the plots ranged from 75 feet2 of basal area per acre to 217 feet2. During this time, MPB populations within the Hills expanded and the fate of the trees on each plot is shown. Plots with densities over 150 feet2 of basal area per acre experienced major mortality as early as 1987 and all of the plots with densities of 90 feet2 of basal area per acre or greater experienced major mortality by 2010. Stands and landscapes within the Black Hills with tree densities ranging from 40 to 80 feet2 of basal area per acre showed considerable resistance to MPBs. Most likely these outcomes were related to the disruption of pheromone plumes facilitated by the open canopy conditions. However, there were exceptions to these findings currently and historically and they are discussed. This publication strives to synthesize a large portion of the information produced in the last 115 years on MPBs and provide this context for informing, planning, and executing forest treatments to produce MPB resilient forests. In addition, it tells an intriguing and fascinating story about bark beetles and the people who tried to understand and control them. © 2016, USDA Forest Service.

However, questions persist as to how fire affects hardwood forest communities and associated wildlife, and how fire should be used to achieve management goals. We provide an up-to-date review of fire effects on various wildlife species and their habitat in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians. Documented direct effects (i.e., mortality) on wildlife are rare. Indirect effects (i.e., changes in habitat quality) are influenced greatly by light availability, fire frequency, and fire intensity. Unless fire intensity is great enough to kill a portion of the overstory, burning in closed-canopy forests has provided little benefit for most wildlife species in the region because it doesn’t result in enough sunlight penetration to elicit understory response. Canopy reduction through silvicultural treatment has enabled managers to use fire more effectively. Fire intensity must be kept low in hardwoods to limit damage to many species of overstory trees. However, wounding or killing trees with fire benefits many wildlife species by allowing increased sunlight to stimulate understory response, snag and subsequent cavity creation, and additions of large coarse woody debris. In general, a fire-return interval of 2 yr to 7 yr benefits a wide variety of wildlife species by providing a diverse structure in the understory, increasing browse, forage, and soft mast, and creating snags and cavities. Historically, dormant-season fire was most prevalent in these regions, and it still is when most prescribed fire is implemented in hardwood systems as burn-days are relatively few in the growing season of May through August because of shading from leaf cover and high fuel moisture. Late growing-season burning increases the window for burning, and better control on woody composition is possible. Early growing-season fire may pose increased risk for some species, especially herpetofauna recently emerged from winter hibernacula (April) or forest songbirds that nest in the understory (May to June). However, negative population-level effects are unlikely unless the burned area is relatively large and early growing-season fire is used continually. We did not find evidence that fire is leading to population declines for any species, including Endangered Species Act (ESA)-listed species (e.g., Indiana bat [Myotis sodalis Mill. Allen] or northern long-eared bat [M. septentrionalis Trouess.]). Instead, data indicate that fire can enhance habitat for bats by increasing suitability of foraging and day-roost sites. Similarly, concern over burning and displacement of woodland salamanders (Plethodontidae), another taxa of heightened conservation concern, is alleviated when fire is prescribed along ecologically appropriate aspect and slope gradients and not forced into mesic, high site index environments where salamanders are most common. Because topography across the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians is diverse, we contend that applying fire on positions best suited for burning is an effective approach to increase regional landscape heterogeneity and biological diversity. Herein, we offer prescriptive concepts for burning for various wildlife species and guilds in the Central Hardwoods and Appalachians. © 2016 Association for Fire Ecology.

Using basal areas obtained from temporary plots and seedbed distributions from field data, seedling densities are simulated for pure Picea mariana (Mill.) and Pinus banksiana (Lamb.) stands under burned intact, and traditional first winter and delayed salvage scenarios. These stands are grouped by age-class, pre-fire stand cover, surficial deposit, and drainage. Following this classification scheme, simulated seedling densities are transferred onto forest inventory maps for the Lake Matagami lowland ecological region (6a) in the boreal forest of Quebec (used as a case study to illustrate the potential of the tool). The final output of the model is an estimate of seedlings/m2 following moderate to severe fire, and fire followed by 100% salvage in pure P. mariana and P. banksiana stands, however it is also capable of simulating partial salvage. Results are expressed as seedlings/ha, and illustrate that in our study area, only 35% of intact P. mariana and 6% of intact P. banksiana stands need to be planted following fire; however under the traditional 100% first winter salvage scenario, 100% of P. mariana and 74% of P. banksiana stands necessitate planting. If salvage logging is delayed until the second, third, or fourth winter following fire, planting will be required in 98%, 88%, and 66% of P. mariana, and 65%, 56%, and 56% of P. banksiana stands respectively. This type of tool allows managers and foresters to quickly assess reforestation needs following fire and salvage at the landscape level, and can be used to better plan the timing and location of salvage operations and subsequent silvicultural treatment application. In addition to being able to schedule operations faster, foresters will also be able to quickly identify regions where natural regeneration could be inadequate or excessive. Potential cost estimates of future interventions such as planting, aerial seeding, and pre-commercial thinning could be made. Foresters can also assess the current vulnerability of management units to fire and can identify regions at particular risk. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Assessment; Forest inventory maps; Model; Natural regeneration; Silviculture",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964501392

Abert's squirrels feed primarily on the inner bark of ponderosa pine branches, as well as the tree's seeds and the hypogenous fungi associated with ponderosa pines. Abert's squirrels require interlocking tree canopies for escape cover and for feeding, particularly in winter months when snow impedes ground travel and the ability of Abert's squirrels to access fungi and hoarded food. In the Southwest, land managers in the ponderosa pine belt are implementing large-scale forest restoration treatments to reduce fire risk and return forest structure to pre-European settlement conditions. Restoration may decrease intrastand structural diversity and interstand heterogeneity for several decades, reducing the amount of habitat available to Abert's squirrels and reducing overall abundance. We estimated Abert's squirrel densities by enumerating squirrel feeding sign (branch clippings, clipped cones, truffle digging) over 9 years on 15 sites on Camp Navajo, an Arizona Army National Guard base in northern Arizona.

The FOFEM (First Order Fire Effects Model) is a commonly used model developed in the western United States to estimate fire effects such as fuel consumption, soil heating, air pollutant emissions, and tree mortality. However, the accuracy of the model in the eastern United States has not been well tested. As a result, managers are turning to locally collected data sets from eastern forests to improve the accuracy of FOFEM and other models. FOFEM lacks local fuel load and consumption data for the Ouachita Mountains, an area with nearly 50,000 ha prescribe burned annually. In this study, we compared fuel loads and consumption using field-collected data with data predicted by FOFEM. We determined fuel loads before and after 15 prescribed fires by sampling live fuels, down woody debris, litter, and duff in three cover types (oak forest, pine-oak forest, and pine woodland) on the Ouachita National Forest in Arkansas. Default estimates of litter and duff fuel load in FOFEM were up to 346 and 1,307% greater than field estimates, respectively. FOFEM estimates of 10-hour, 1-hour, and litter fuel consumption were up to 182, 150, and 46% greater, respectively, than field-measured consumption. These overestimations of fuel load and consumption could result in overpredictions of air pollutant emissions and reduce the area of habitat restored and maintained by prescribed burning as fire managers seek to comply with air quality standards. © 2016 Society of American Foresters.","Fire effects models; Fire emissions; Fuel Characteristic Classification System; Shortleaf pine",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84974806577

Given that fire size and severity are predicted to increase in the future, it has become increasingly important to understand how wildlife responds to fire and post-fire management. The Angora Fire burned 1243 hectares of mixed conifer forest in South Lake Tahoe, California. We conducted avian point counts for the first 3 years following the fire in burned and unburned areas to investigate which habitat characteristics are most important for re-establishing or maintaining the native avian community in post-fire landscapes. We used a multi-species occurrence model to estimate how avian species are influenced by the density of live and dead trees and shrub cover. While accounting for variations in the detectability of species, our approach estimated the occurrence probabilities of all species detected including those that were rare or observed infrequently. Although all species encountered in this study were detected in burned areas, species-specific modeling results predicted that some species were strongly associated with specific post-fire conditions, such as a high density of dead trees, open-canopy conditions or high levels of shrub cover that occur at particular burn severities or at a particular time following fire. These results indicate that prescribed fire or managed wildfire which burns at low to moderate severity without at least some high-severity effects is both unlikely to result in the species assemblages that are unique to post-fire areas or to provide habitat for burn specialists. Additionally, the probability of occurrence for many species was associated with high levels of standing dead trees indicating that intensive post-fire harvest of these structures could negatively impact habitat of a considerable proportion of the avian community. © 2015 The Zoological Society of London","avian community; biodiversity; fire severity; forest fires; forest management; hierarchical modeling; post-fire management; salvage logging",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945540048

Among the natural disturbances in Europe, windstorms cause the highest economic loss. After such storms, damaged forest stands are commonly salvage logged to restore economic value. However, such interventions could affect species assemblages of various taxonomic groups, including breeding birds. Despite these potential effects, investigations of the impacts of post-storm logging are largely lacking. We thus investigated assemblages of breeding birds in 21 logged and 21 unlogged windstorm-disturbed forest plots and 18 undisturbed, control forest plots using fixed-radius point-stop counts three, five and seven years after a windstorm within the Bavarian Forest National Park as part of the European Long-Term Ecosystem Research Network. We recorded 2100 bird individuals of 55 bird species. Bird assemblages were predominantly altered by the consequences of the windstorm and affected only to a minor degree by subsequent logging of storm-felled trees. Nevertheless, bird species richness was significantly reduced by post-storm logging within the first season. In general, the windstorm led to a shift in bird assemblage composition from typical forest species towards open- and shrub-land species. Assemblages of logged and unlogged disturbed plots consisted mainly of long-distance migrants and ground-foraging bird species, whereas assemblages of undisturbed control plots consisted of resident species that forage within vegetation. Both unlogged and logged storm-felled coniferous forest stands were inhabited by endangered or declining bird species, such as Water Pipit (Anthus spinoletta) on logged plots and Eurasian Redstart (Phoenicurus phoenicurus) on unlogged plots. Indicator species analyses suggested that species of unlogged storm disturbed plots depended on storm-created legacies, such as pits and snags, for foraging and nesting. Hence, we recommend reducing post-storm logging of these legacies to support species restricted to unlogged disturbed forest. To increase the diversity of breeding birds on the landscape scale, diverse logged and unlogged post-disturbance stands should be provided, which could be gained by a partial benign neglect strategy of storm disturbed forest stands. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Impacts of outbreaks can be environmental, economic, and social, and an ecosystem services (ES) viewpoint provides a useful perspective for an integrated approach to assessing these impacts and may help to identify how possible management strategies could minimize these impacts. In this regards, a comprehensive overview of the ecosystem functions and socioeconomic factors that have been impacted by the current outbreaks in western Canada was carried out to facilitate a more general ES assessment. In addition to timber production, current MPB outbreaks have negative effects on provisioning services (water supply and food production) and aesthetic cultural services, while effects on regulating services (carbon and forest fire) are still in debate. Among the supporting services, nutrient cycling and aquatic habitat showed short-and long-term negative effects, while terrestrial habitat showed a mostly positive response. The overall impact on ES may be more severe if salvage logging is practiced as a post-MPB forest management strategy. The outcomes of this study may help to identify areas of greatest socioecological vulnerability to MPB and identify knowledge gaps and avenues for research to advance the ES framework for MPB outbreak management. © 2016, Canadian Science Publishing.

However, the application of theory developed in simple experimental systems to complex natural systems has spurred debate regarding whether predation risk, independent of direct killing, can structure ecosystems. We examined the effects of white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) foraging under the risk of predation by coyotes on oak (Quercus spp.) regeneration and the abundance of palatable understory species in a frequently burned longleaf pine savanna. Oaks represent a common but relatively low quality forage item for deer, and are an important component of this system because oak encroachment into pine-dominated uplands can reduce biodiversity. In frequently burned ecosystems oaks and other fire-impeding species often exist in a demographic fire-trap, where they sprout following fire but rarely escape into the midstory, because they are repeatedly top-killed by subsequent fires. Many factor including herbivory stress can influence the probability of fire survival for oak saplings. Other Cervids, including elk (Cervus canadensis) and moose (Alces alces) are known to increase use of woody browse with predation risk because of selection for brushy areas that offer concealment cover. We experimentally manipulated predation risk for 10 years, by establishing 4 approximately 40-ha predator exclosures and 4 control plots to test the effects of predation risk on aspects of the plant community. Reduced predation risk resulted in increased oak recruitment and decreased abundance of palatable forage. A density-mediated trophic cascade does not explain the release of oaks and our results provide support the behaviorally-mediated trophic cascade hypothesis. We offer evidence that frequent disturbance can facilitate trophic cascades and that predator-sensitive foraging can enhance fire suppression of oaks and influence groundcover composition in longleaf pine savannas. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Canis latrans; Coyote; Fire; Longleaf pine; Non-consumptive effects; Oak recruitment; Odocoileus virginianus; Predation risk; Prescribed fire; Trophic cascade; White-tailed deer",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960355362

For many animals, occupancy and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes. Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single home range or territory. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests. Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with independently collected survey data, showing that the model is successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as relative abundance within and among fires. The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for fine-scale modelling of density and abundance for other territorial yet elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation efforts that require snag removal. © 2015 The Authors.","Picoides arcticus; Bayesian; Black-backed Woodpecker; Density; Home range; Population size; Wildlife habitat model",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949818344

We need to understand species and community responses to wildfire and how responses vary regionally to effectively manage dry conifer forests for maintaining biodiversity. We compared avian relationships with wildfire burn severity between two dry forest locations of Arizona and Idaho. We predicted different responses to wildfire between locations due to regional differences in historical fire regime. We conducted point count surveys for 3 yr following wildfire (Arizona: 1997-1999; Idaho: 2008-2010) and used multispecies hierarchical models to analyze relationships of bird occupancy with burn severity. Consistent with our prediction for mixed-severity fire regimes characterizing the Idaho location, we observed proportionately more positive species occupancy relationships and, consequently, a positive species richness relationship with burn severity in Idaho. We also observed the opposite pattern in Arizona, which was congruent with our prediction for the low-severity fire regime characterizing that location. Cavity nesters and aerial insectivores occupied more severely burned sites following wildfire, corresponding with predicted increases in nesting substrate and foraging opportunities for these species. In contrast, canopy-nesting foliage gleaners and pine seed consumers exhibited negative relationships with burn severity. Our results were consistent with predictions based on species life histories and with patterns from the literature, suggesting generality of observed relationships and locational difference in relationships with wildfire. We therefore suggest that optimal management strategies for maintaining avian diversity could differ regionally.

Oak savanna restoration projects are primarily driven by species closely linked to this habitat type, such as the federally endangered Karner blue butterfly (Lycaeides melissa samuelis). However, it is essential that other species are monitored during restoration. Small mammals, due to their importance in ecosystem function, are particularly useful to study. The United States Forest Service is currently conducting an oak savanna restoration in the Manistee National Forest in Lower Michigan using forest thinning and prescribed burning. To understand management impacts on small mammal communities, we live trapped small mammals in each of the mechanically thinned plots (i.e., bulldozer, masticator, and shear cutter) and control plots in five blocks over six years (2008-2013), as well as measured vegetation variables each year. Initially, we used a permutation multivariate analysis of variance (perMANOVA) to determine if there were treatment and year interactions for both small mammal community assemblages and vegetation variables. We then compared changes in small mammal diversity, relative abundance, and vegetation variables among treatments using exploratory randomized block design analysis of variances (ANOVAs). Canopy cover was significantly lower in bulldozer and shear cutter thinned plots than control plots five years following thinning. We observed significant treatment by year interactions in how the small mammal community responded. A large increase in relative abundance of white-footed mice occurred one year post-thinning in all treatments. Within 1-2 years of treatment, thirteen-lined ground squirrels and meadow jumping mice, both open-canopy grassland species became established on thinned plots. The retention of brush piles in bulldozer and shear cutter plots provided important refuge habitat for small mammals following thinning. Restoration efforts were beneficial to the small mammal community overall and promoted grassland species to immigrate into the restored area. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Habitat restoration; Michigan; Oak savanna; Quercus spp.; Small mammals; Thinning",Editorial,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960079770

These practices are most prevalent on public and private lands where management is funded through hunting licenses and hunting tourism. Habitat management for game species is globally widespread and can take diverse forms - e.g. tree reduction to enhance forage for deer in the United States and burning moorlands in Scotland to increase habitat for wading birds. Yet the effects of these practices on non-targeted animals are poorly understood. Given limited funding for conservation and increasing threats to biodiversity, understanding the shared benefits and unintended consequences of game management for other species is important. To quantify and characterize existing studies on this topic, we synthesized scientific literature that measured the effects of game management on non-targeted animals. We found surprisingly few studies (n = 26), and the outcomes of these studies illustrated that, through diverse mechanisms, game management can have positive, negative or no effect on non-target taxa. Our analysis suggests that the explicit evaluation of the effects of game management on other species is rare but warranted, offering opportunities to advance ecological understanding and conservation of both target and non-target species.

In northeast India, landscapes under shifting agriculture (or jhum) practiced by tribal communities are increasingly being replaced by monoculture plantations (e.g., teak, oil palm). We compared oil palm and teak plantations, shifting agricultural fields, and forest fallows (0-8 yr regeneration) with tropical rainforest edge and interior sites in Dampa Tiger Reserve, Mizoram, India. Twenty replicate transects were surveyed in each of the 5 study strata for vegetation structure, bird species richness and density, bird abundance, and species composition. Tree density and canopy and vertical structure were lowest in oil palm plantations, intermediate in teak plantations and jhum, and highest in rainforest sites. Tree density in jhum (4.3 stems per 100 m2) was much higher than in oil palm plantations (0.5 stems per 100 m2), but lower than in rainforest (6.8-8.2 stems per 100 m2), with bamboo absent in oil palm plantations and most abundant in regenerating jhum (25 culms per 50 m2). We recorded 107 bird species (94 forest species, 13 open-country species). Oil palm plantations had the lowest forest bird species richness (10 species), followed by teak plantations (38), while jhum (50) had only slightly lower species richness than the rainforest edge (58) and interior (70). Forest bird abundance in the jhum landscape was similar to that in rainforest, on average 304% higher than in oil palm plantations, and 87% higher than in teak plantations. Jhum sites were more similar in bird community composition to rainforest than were monocultures. Rapid recovery of dense and diverse secondary bamboo forests during fallow periods makes the shifting agricultural landscape mosaic a better form of land use for bird conservation than monocultures. Land use policy and conservation plans should provide greater support for shifting agriculture, while mandating better land use practices such as retention of forest remnants, native trees, and riparian vegetation in monoculture plantations. © 2016 Cooper Ornithological Society.","biodiversity hotspot; bird communities; Elaeis guineensis; jhum; land use change; rainforest; slash-and-burn agriculture; Tectona grandis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964720704

Maintaining native species and characteristic processes requires this successional diversity, but methods to achieve it are poorly explained in the literature. In the Inland Pacific US, large, old, early seral trees were a key historical feature of many young and old forest successional patches, especially where fires frequently occurred. Large, old trees are naturally fire-tolerant, but today are often threatened by dense understory cohorts that create fuel ladders that alter likely post-fire successional pathways. Reducing these understories can contribute to resistance by creating conditions where canopy trees will survive disturbances and climatic stressors; these survivors are important seed sources, soil protectors, and critical habitat elements. Historical timber harvesting has skewed tree size and age class distributions, created hard edges, and altered native patch sizes. Manipulating these altered forests to promote development of larger patches of older, larger, and more widely-spaced trees with diverse understories will increase landscape resistance to severe fires, and enhance wildlife habitat for underrepresented conditions.Closed-canopy, multi-layered patches that develop in hot, dry summer environments are vulnerable to droughts, and they increase landscape vulnerability to insect outbreaks and severe wildfires. These same patches provide habitat for species such as the northern spotted owl, which has benefited from increased habitat area. Regional and local planning will be critical for gauging risks, evaluating trade-offs, and restoring dynamics that can support these and other species. The goal will be to manage for heterogeneous landscapes that include variably-sized patches of (1) young, middle-aged, and old, closed-canopy forests growing in upper montane, northerly aspect, and valley bottom settings, (2) a similar diversity of open-canopy, fire-tolerant patches growing on ridgetops, southerly aspects, and lower montane settings, and (3) significant montane chaparral and grassland areas. Tools to achieve this goal include managed wildfire, prescribed burning, and variable density thinning at small to large scales. Specifics on ""how much and where?"" will vary according to physiographic, topographic and historical templates, and regulatory requirements, and be determined by means of a socio-ecological process. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Early successional habitats; Forest resilience; Multi-scale heterogeneity; Patch size distributions; Resistance; Topographic controls",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84962705516

One such shortcut is the umbrella species approach, whereby conservation actions are geared toward one or a few key species, with the assumption that the entire community will benefit. However, fitness-habitat associations and resource use may vary across space and across management regimes, and so too may the utility of umbrella species as ecosystem surrogates. The federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) has been used as an umbrella species in the restoration of the longleaf pine ecosystem of the southeastern US. Restoration efforts were based on early habitat selection information in largely degraded landscapes. We examined patterns of resource selection of 97 social groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers in a restored landscape in northwest Florida. Similar to previous studies in degraded landscapes, woodpecker groups selected forest stands containing higher densities of large pines and lower densities of small pines for foraging. However, we found no evidence for another aspect of habitat selection widely documented in degraded habitat, the avoidance of areas with substantial components of hardwoods. These results align with new woodpecker fitness-habitat associations within restored landscapes and lend support to previous findings that current ecosystem restoration efforts in the study area, namely prescribed burning, may have reduced hardwood densities to below those at which they have negative impacts. The red-cockaded woodpecker has served as an effective umbrella species in degraded longleaf ecosystems by promoting management, especially prescribed burning, that benefits many other species. Whether it will continue to do so in restored habitat is not yet clear, but its tolerance of a range of hardwood conditions provides reason for optimism. © 2016 The Zoological Society of London.","Conservation actions; Ecosystem restoration; Fitness; Picoides borealis; Red-cockaded woodpecker; Resource selection; Umbrella species",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938125306

Our study utilized an extensive set of field plots established following four fires that occurred between 2000 and 2010 in the northern Sierra Nevada, California, USA that were subsequently reburned in 2012. The information obtained from these field plots allowed for a unique set of analyses investigating the effect of vegetation, fuels, topography, fire weather, and forest management on reburn severity. We also examined the influence of initial fire severity and time since initial fire on influential predictors of reburn severity. Our results suggest that high- to moderateseverity fire in the initial fires led to an increase in standing snags and shrub vegetation, which in combination with severe fire weather promoted high-severity fire effects in the subsequent reburn. Although fire behavior is largely driven by weather, our study demonstrates that post-fire vegetation composition and structure are also important drivers of reburn severity. In the face of changing climatic regimes and increases in extreme fire weather, these results may provide managers with options to create more fire-resilient ecosystems. In areas where frequent high-severity fire is undesirable, management activities such as thinning, prescribed fire, or managed wildland fire can be used to moderate fire behavior not only prior to initial fires, but also before subsequent reburns. © 2016 by the Ecological Society of America.","Fire ecology; Fire hazard; Fire severity; Interacting fires; Post-fire restoration; Reburn; Sierra Nevada, California, USA",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964807880

In recent decades, managers of the longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem have transitioned from dormant-season to growing-season burns, which more effectively limit midstory hardwood encroachment. Similarly, aggressive hardwood removal programs have been employed to further reduce hardwood midstory. However, fox squirrels are dependent on oaks (Quercus spp.) for food and cover; thus, it is unclear how growingseason burns and hardwood removal may affect habitat quality for fox squirrels. We used compositional analysis to investigate selection of home ranges within the study area by 48 radiocollared fox squirrels on the Fort Bragg Military Installation, North Carolina. We used resource utilization functions with growing-season fire history and other habitat covariates as explanatory variables to test whether growing-season fires influenced the selection of habitat components within home ranges. Lastly, using a sample of fox squirrel relocations and paired random points, we performed binomial logistic regression to test whether habitat selection by fox squirrels was influenced by the availability of oaks and longleaf pines and select forest stand structural characteristics. When establishing home ranges, fox squirrels selected southern yellow pine over other cover types. Within home ranges, fox squirrel use increased with decreasing distance to a riparian area but was not affected by the application of growing-season fires. At the population level, fox squirrels selected for greater densities of reproductively mature oak stems. Fox squirrels likely benefit from growing-season fires that maintain expansive upland pine stands but are negatively affected by homogeneous fire application and mechanical hardwood removal that reduce the occurrence of reproductively mature oaks across the landscape. Managers should strive to maintain oaks in riparian areas, fire shadows, and naturally occurring patches within pine stands when managing for fox squirrels. © 2016 American Society of Mammalogists.","Growing-season fire; Hardwood; Longleaf pine; Oak; Prescribed fire; Quercus; Sciurus Niger",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84964434480

These metrics represent critical habitat components for various wildlife species of conservation concern, including the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), which is strongly associated with recently burned conifer forest. We assessed the potential of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) to detect and characterize conifer snags and identify Black-backed Woodpecker habitat using previously derived empirical thresholds of conifer snag basal area. Over the footprint of the Rim Fire, a megafire that extended (~104,000 ha) through a heterogeneous mosaic of conifer forests, oak woodlands, and meadows in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, we identified conifer snags and estimated their basal area from single-tree ALS-derived metrics using Gaussian processes in four major steps. First, individual trees were mapped using the Watershed Segmentation algorithm, resulting in 87% detection of trees with stem diameter larger than 30cm. Second, the snag/live classification model identified snags with an overall accuracy of 91.8%, using the coefficient of variation of height and intensity together with maximum intensity and fractional cover as the most relevant metrics. Third, the conifer/hardwood snag classification model utilizing the maximum height, median height, minimum intensity, and area metrics separated snag forest types with an overall accuracy of 84.8%. Finally, a Gaussian process regression model reliably estimated conifer snag stem diameter (R2 = 0.81) using height and crown area, thus significantly outperforming regionally calibrated conifer-specific allometric equations. As a result, ~80% of the snag basal area have been mapped.

Reference old-growth woodlands and forests can be used as benchmarks for emulating historic structure and spatial and temporal patterns of tree establishment and death. Southeastern USA longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) woodlands and savannas, formerly extensive ecosystems now considered among the most imperiled in the USA, lack long-term data on growth and mortality, particularly in the mountain provinces. We used permanent plots established in 1999 in two old-growth stands (Caffey Hill and Red-Tail Ridge) in northern Alabama to evaluate changes in stand structure and examine spatial patterns and drivers of growth and mortality over a 15-year period. Both stands experienced substantial tree mortality (12% and 26%) and initial decreases in stand basal area in response to periodic fires; however by 2014 both stands had recovered and exceeded 1999 basal area. Average annual rates of mortality ranged between 1.0% and 1.8% across the two stands. Pine ingrowth over the 15year period differed significantly by site, with 182.0 and 6.7 new trees ha-1 at Caffey Hill and Red-Tail Ridge, respectively. Stem density (live longleaf pines ha-1) increased by 32% at Caffey Hill and decreased by 16% at Red-Tail Ridge. The ingrowth and mortality of longleaf pine in both stands was significantly spatially clustered. Density-dependent mortality affected smaller pines (2.5-10cm DBH), accelerating self-thinning of dense patches of young pines. These long-term data illustrate the dynamic nature of two old-growth mountain longleaf pine stands and provide insight into longleaf pine stand dynamics and more broadly to the understanding of dynamics within fire-prone woodlands. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Density-dependent mortality; Gap formation; Prescribed fire; Spatial patterns; Stand structure; Tree mortality",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955261426

We examined foraging by an at-risk cavity excavator, the white-headed woodpecker (Picoides albolarvatus). The foraging needs of this species are used to inform management of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in some areas of western North America. Past observational studies indicated that white-headed woodpeckers forage predominately on cones and trunks of large-diameter (&gt;68cm) pines in old-growth stands, although habitat selection while foraging has not been formally examined. We used radio telemetry to track forage substrate use among 37 adult, breeding woodpeckers for 176h (10,576min) in forest stands that had been recently thinned and/or burned with prescribed fire. We used discrete choice models to examine forage site selection and multinomial regression to examine consequences of foraging on nest productivity. Woodpeckers foraged on more than ten individual substrates and switched substrates seasonally, presumably to take advantage of prey availability. Dead wood and fir foliage were used commonly in the nesting period (86% and 68% of foraging, respectively), whereas pine foliage and trunk foraging dominated in the fledgling (66% of foraging) and post-fledgling periods (73% of foraging). Average size of used trees was 49cm (±20cm) and pine cones were rarely used (4% of foraging). During the nesting period, substrate use (χ2=1.49, df=4, P=0.83) and distances traveled from nests for foraging did not affect productivity (F(3,16)=0.61, P=0.62), which was high even for birds with the longest (2.1km) and shortest (0.39km) maximum forage distances. Habitats selected for foraging matched substrate use, and woodpeckers selected areas with low basal areas of live trees in the nesting period, but high basal areas in the post-nesting period. The variable foraging that we observed suggests that white-headed woodpeckers are plastic in their foraging in managed forests, and this plasticity has no negative consequences for productivity. © 2015.","Forage site selection; Nest productivity; Picoides albolarvatus; Pinus ponderosa; Ponderosa pine",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951787897

Results show that, with every scenario, the mean area burned will likely increase on a provincial scale, while some areas might expect decreases with a low emission scenario.

Changes to natural disturbance regimes can place early successional habitat specialists at an increased risk of extinction by altering landscape patterns of habitat suitability. Objectives: We developed a series of hypotheses to evaluate the effects of landscape structure, fire history, and site-level habitat quality on site occupancy by an early successional specialist, the eastern chestnut mouse (Pseudomys gracilicaudatus). Methods: We obtained eight years of monitoring data from 26 sites in recently burned heathland in southeast Australia. We used generalised linear models to determine which explanatory variables were related to occupancy. We also explored predictability in patterns of small mammal species co-occurrence. Results: Landscape structure (patch area, landscape heterogeneity) was strongly related to site occupancy. Site occupancy was associated with dead shrubs in the understory and rock cover on ground layer, but was not directly influenced by recent or historical fire. Contrary to contemporary ecological theory, we found no predictable species associations in our early successional community. Conclusions: We recommend surveys take account of landscape configuration and proximity to suitable habitat for optimal results. Fire regimes expected to promote eastern chestnut mouse population growth should encourage the retention of critical habitat features rather than be based on temporal rates of successional stages. For management to adequately account for post-disturbance patterns in early successional communities, a species-by-species, multi-scaled approach to research is necessary. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Fire; Habitat specialist; Heathland; Landscape heterogeneity; Patch area; Succession",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955345968

First, many plant and animal species use, and have sometimes evolved to depend on, severely burned forest conditions for their persistence. Second, evidence from fire history studies also suggests that a complex mosaic of severely burned conifer patches was common historically in the West. Third, to maintain ecological integrity in forests born of mixed-severity fire, land managers will have to accept some severe fire and maintain the integrity of its aftermath. Lastly, public education messages surrounding fire could be modified so that people better understand and support management designed to maintain ecologically appropriate sizes and distributions of severe fire and the complex early-seral forest conditions it creates.

Fire return intervals decreased, resulting in local extirpation or population declines of many bird species adapted to post-fire plant communities. Within Great Smoky Mountains National Park, declines have been strongest for birds inhabiting xeric pine-oak forests that depend on frequent fire. The buildup of fuels after decades of fire suppression led to changes in the 1996 Great Smoky Mountains Fire Management Plan. Although fire return intervals remain well below historic levels, management changes have helped increase the amount of fire within the park over the past 20 years, providing an opportunity to study patterns of fire severity, time since burn, and bird occurrence. We combined avian point counts in burned and unburned areas with remote sensing indices of fire severity to infer temporal changes in bird occurrence for up to 28 years following fire. Using hierarchical linear models that account for the possibility of a species presence at a site when no individuals are detected, we developed occurrence models for 24 species: 13 occurred more frequently in burned areas, 2 occurred less frequently, and 9 showed no significant difference between burned and unburned areas. Within burned areas, the top models for each species included fire severity, time since burn, or both, suggesting that fire influenced patterns of species occurrence for all 24 species. Our findings suggest that no single fire management strategy will suit all species. To capture peak occupancy for the entire bird community within xeric pine-oak forests, at least 3 fire regimes may be necessary; one applying frequent low severity fire, another using infrequent low severity fire, and a third using infrequently applied high severity fire. © 2016 Cooper Ornithological Society.","Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio; Fire Severity; Fire Suppression; Pine-Oak Forest; Time Since Fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84954469135

The purpose of this study is to quantify historical tree spatial patterns and assess recent mortality trends for old and large tree populations in dry mixed-conifer forests of the Northern Rocky Mountains. We analyzed historical reconstructions of forest spatial structure across six 1.0ha plots located in mixed ponderosa pine/Douglas-fir stands in western Montana, USA. Across plots, 10-23% of trees occurred as widely spaced individuals (no neighbors within 6m), with the remaining 77-90% of trees occurring in clumps (groups of two or more trees spaced less than 6m apart). Mean clump size was 2.2-4.2 trees per clump, although large clumps (&gt;10 trees) were common. Global spatial analysis with the pair correlation function indicated that ponderosa pine patterns were spatially random at all scales, while Douglas-fir trees were spatially aggregated at scales less than 6m. The proportion of plot area farther than 9m from the nearest tree ranged from 1% to 20% across the six study plots. Mortality rates between 1991 and 2012 averaged 0.8%yr-1 for old ponderosa pine and 2.1%yr-1 for old Douglas-fir. We found limited evidence of density-dependent mortality for both species pooled and for ponderosa pine individually. Douglas-fir that died between 1991 and 2012 had higher local Stand Density Index (SDI) of Douglas-fir neighbors than did Douglas-fir that survived (P=0.003), indicating conspecific density-dependent mortality. When compared to ponderosa pine and dry mixed-conifer forests in other regions, trees were distributed much more evenly across clump sizes in our Montana study sites. Our analysis provides an estimate of the historical range of variability for spatial aspects of forest structure in dry mixed-conifer forests of the northern US Rockies and is relevant to the design of restoration and climate change adaptation treatments in such forests. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Density-dependent mortality; Forest restoration; Fuel reduction; Ponderosa pine; Reference conditions; Tree spatial patterns",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946866156

We characterized the community structure and niche characteristics (niche position, marginality, breadth) of upland and lowland boreal birds at scales relevant to both natural and human disturbance patterns in western boreal forests undergoing rapid and extensive multi-sector resource development. Our goal was to identify the degree of ecological specialization in order to inform activities directed at conserving a diversity of species (e.g. specialists and generalists) within the western boreal bird community. We used avian data (>5,220 point counts) and environmental variable data comprised of forest composition, stand, and landscape pattern metrics at local (7.1. ha), landscape (1,963. ha), and regional (11,310. ha) scales to determine boreal bird distribution and community-level associations using Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) and Outlying Mean Index (OMI) analysis. OMI analysis explained a high proportion of variance in the dataset (71.8%) and separated boreal birds along two axes associated with moisture-productivity and age-structural complexity gradients. Niche position was influenced by local scale variables (height, age, area of mature-old forest, area of wet soil types), but also landscape and regional scale variables (total area of hardwood and conifer, mean nearest neighbour distance of conifer, and total core area of productive upland conifer). Only 15 of 67 species (22%) had marginal (atypical) niches and narrow niche breadths exhibiting specialization in old hardwood and white spruce forests and burned, open, and lowland habitats.

Fire is important in the long-term dynamics of cavity creation and loss, but there are few data on how fire impacts nesting resource availability for animals. We assessed the survival of 189 trees and 191 cavities used for nesting by an endangered secondary cavity nesting bird, the swift parrot Lathamus discolor, over a decade. A subset of monitored trees were burned in an uncontrolled fire. At the site of that fire, we compared swift parrot habitat quality before and after burning. We also evaluated the risk of total tree collapse due to stem destabilisation from basal scarring by calculating the critical failure stress for all monitored trees. Modelled persistence of unburned swift parrot nest cavities was more than twice that of scorched cavities over ten years. Likewise, unburned nest trees were more likely to still be standing at the end of the ten years than scorched trees. Fire caused an acute local increase in cavity and tree collapse. At the site of the fire, 62.8% of scorched nest cavities were destroyed compared to only 9.1% over the unburned remainder of the study area. Likewise, 48.6% of scorched nest trees collapsed at the fire affected site, compared to only 3.8% of unburned trees elsewhere. Burning associated tree collapse led to a significant decrease in tree diameter at breast height and number of potential cavities at monitored plots. This destroyed most of the existing nest cavity resource for swift parrots at the local scale and cavity abundance is unlikely to be replenished quickly. Loss of nesting resources may outweigh longer-term benefits of fire as an agent of cavity creation if animals miss opportunities for reproduction in locations where habitat is diminished by cumulative stochastic events and anthropogenic changes. ï¿½ 2015 .","Carrying capacity; Forest; Lathamus discolor; Survival analysis; Threatened species; Tree hollow",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945574865

We examined the effects of fire severity distribution on spatial and temporal variation in movement of an Australian arboreal mammal, the mountain brushtail possum (Trichosurus cunninghami). We used GPS telemetry to characterise the movements of 18 possums in landscapes burnt to differing extents by a large wildfire. We identified a temporal change in movement patterns in response to fire. In unburnt landscapes, individuals moved greater distances early and late in the night and had less overlap in the areas used for foraging and denning, than in high-severity burnt landscapes. Habitat selection was dependent on the spatial context of fire in the surrounding landscape. Forest recently burnt at high severity may provide suitable habitat for species such as the mountain brushtail possum, if protected from subsequent disturbance, such as salvage logging. However, spatial and temporal patterns of habitat use and selection differ considerably between burnt and undisturbed landscapes. The spatial outcomes of ecological disturbances such as wildfires have the potential to alter the behaviour and functional roles of fauna across large areas. © IAWF 2016.","biodiversity; ecosystems; fire regimes; mosaic; post-fire effects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85002702344

A comparative study of disturbed and undisturbed sites was conducted in miombo woodlands of Zambia to assess impacts of environmental stressors on birds. Foot patrols were employed to locate, identify and count host trees and cavities for cavity-nesting birds on twenty 200 m × 200 m sample plots. Undisturbed forests had three times more cavities (the nesting sites for birds), while there were 24.6% fewer abandoned cavities in undisturbed forests than in disturbed forests. The rate of cavity abandonment was about twice as high in human-dominated forests compared to undisturbed forests (61.3% c.f. 31.9%). Cavity-nesting birds preferred larger (> 36.0 cm diameter at breast height) and taller (> 5.0 m) trees for nest placement, especially in human-dominated forests. A number of cavity-nesting birds preferred Brachystegia spiciformis (zebrawood), Julbernadia paniculata (munsa), Parinari curatellifolia (mobola-plum) and Uapaca kirkiana (mahobohobo) as host trees to 14 other miombo tree species. Arnot’s Chat (Myrmecocichla arnoti) had a wider selection of host trees for cavity-nesting than the other 40 cavity-nesting birds in the study areas. Anthropogenic activities such as uncontrolled firewood collection, wild fires, logging, and land clearing for agriculture negatively influenced wood abundance and diversity, with potential implications for persistence of cavity-nesting birds. The negative impacts of anthropogenic activities could be counteracted by conservation strategies such as implementation of sound forest policies, integrative land use practices, sustainable livelihood security and stakeholders’ awareness of the need to safeguard forest-dependent avifauna. Conservation implications: This comparative study unravels specific anthropogenic impacts on the cavity-nesting birds in the miombo woodlands, which would be relevant for designing and implementing targeted biodiversity conservation interventions against negative local environmental values and attitudes that support rural development on the expense of conservation of biodiversity such as birds. © 2016.

How these fires affect occupancy and use of the forest by wildlife is of great concern, in particular, the differential response of non-native and native species. In the North American Southwest, prior to European settlement, frequent wildfires helped to maintain forest structure. We examined the effect of a large wildfire on an introduced population of the Abert’s squirrel (Sciurus aberti) that has invaded the high elevation forests inhabited by the critically endangered Mt. Graham red squirrel (Tamiasciurus fremonti grahamensis). We found that introduced Abert’s squirrels were more common than native red squirrels in burned areas. Abert’s squirrels did not abandon burned areas but nested, foraged, and did not adjust their home range size in burned areas. This suggests that invasive Abert’s squirrels are better able to exploit burned areas than native red squirrels and that fire can favor non-native species. This interaction between non-native species, native species, and fire adds new insight into the complexities of conservation and restoration of ecosystems and helps to inform conservation activities worldwide. © 2017, Associazione Teriologica Italiana onlus.

In woodpeckers, males often have an equal or greater contribution to parental care, including nest sanitation. The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a North American boreal woodpecker for which both parents are highly involved in parental care. By modifying their territory size in optimal and suboptimal habitat (e.g. burned vs unburned habitats), this species seems to have a large tolerance to variation in prey abundance at a landscape scale, and could provide a useful biological model to investigate the adaptability of parent care, particularly to relative contribution of each sex. We investigated sex-and habitat-specific parental care behaviour of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 9 nests by daily monitoring during the nestling period. Specifically, we examined two different aspects of parental care: 1) time spent at the nest, and 2) food delivery. We also compared relative contribution between sexes to nest sanitation. Despite our small sample sizes, our results show that males are more involved in nest sanitation and spend longer at the nest, and both sexes exhibit higher food delivery rates and spend less time at the nest in burned habitat. This latter result may suggest that greater effort is needed to provision Black-backed Woodpecker nestlings in unburned habitat compared to burned habitat. © 2016, BirdLife Hungary.

Do the impacts of ungulates on exotic vs native plants depend on forest management activities such as prescribed fire and stand thinning? Location: Northeastern Oregon, USA. Methods: We recorded changes in richness and cover of different exotic and native plant life forms in experimental plots that were grazed only by cattle (a non-native herbivore), only by elk (a native herbivore) or not grazed by any ungulate over a 7-yr period at both managed (recently burned and thinned) and unmanaged (where no fire and thinning has occurred in >40 yr) forest stands. Results: There was a general decrease in exotic plant species richness and cover across all treatments. However, the decrease in exotic richness, particularly of exotic annual forbs, was slightly lower in plots grazed by elk than in ungrazed plots at managed stands. Managed stands also displayed a larger increase in native annual forb richness and exotic graminoid richness, and a larger decrease in native perennial graminoid cover with cattle grazing than elk grazing. At unmanaged stands, cover of woody native plants such as shrubs, sub-shrubs and trees as well as native perennial forbs decreased or remained relatively constant with elk grazing while increasing strongly at plots that were ungrazed or grazed by cattle. Conclusions: Cattle and elk have variable effects on different plant guilds at managed vs unmanaged forest stands. Overall, cattle grazing tends to have a larger impact on herbaceous plant guilds at managed stands, while elk grazing tends to have a larger impact on woody plant guilds at unmanaged stands. However, in contrast to findings from other ecosystems, grazing only has a minor impact on exotic plant dynamics in our study area, and cattle grazing does not favour exotic plants any more than grazing by elk or ungulate exclusion. © 2016 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Conditioned Correspondence Analysis; Conifer Forest Management; Grazing; Non-Native Species; Prescribed Burning; Stand Thinning; Ungulates",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957438350

In this study, a total of 149 bird species (from 5,317 individuals) were recorded. Of the 103 species for which densities could be calculated, 45% were lowland bird specialists (i.e. species occurring below 200 m above sea level in Sumatra), including three globally threatened and 41 Near-Threatened species. Comparison with bird densities in degraded forest of Borneo revealed that there was broad similarity across taxa but three species had significantly higher density, and four had significantly lower density, in HRF. The mosaic of degraded forest habitats in different stages of regeneration in HRF appears to support more individuals of some species, especially woodpeckers, than the Bornean sites, but fewer individuals of other species. Determining bird densities is essential to establish population baselines, allowing comparisons between sites and over time.

On one side are recommendations to create both extensive open and park-like pine forests, and to reduce high-severity fire occurrence by mechanical thinning of forests. These recommendations drive current management. On the other side are recommendations to manage landscapes for both dense, old forest, and complex early-seral forest that is created by both high-severity and moderate-severity fires characteristic of historical fire regimes. Our research suggests that the latter approach may best maintain forest associated with two imperiled species that are top management concerns of federal agencies in the Sierra Nevada: the California Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) and the Pacific Fisher (Pekania pennanti). We used spatially extensive US Forest Service forest survey data from 1910 and 1911, and synthesized research from other parts of this region for comparison, to assess reference conditions in low/mid-elevation Sierra Nevada forests. We found that historical ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests had a mixed-severity fire regime, with an average of 26% high-severity fire effects, and varied more widely in species composition and density than suggested by previous research. Our findings are contrary to other reports using a very small subset (∼6%) of the available data from these same 1910 and 1911 surveys. Therefore, we suggest that historical reference conditions of forests in the Sierra Nevada range of these species are not like that reported previously in other studies, and that mixed-severity fire, and forests defined by strong contrasts and dynamic natural processes, were characteristic of historical ponderosa pine and mixed-conifer forests of the western Sierra Nevada. Our analysis indicates that managing for both dense, old forests, and protecting complex early-seral forest created by high-severity fire, will likely advance conservation and recovery of the Spotted Owl and Pacific Fisher, while current management direction may exacerbate threats.","Mixed-conifer; mixed-severity fire; Pacific Fisher; ponderosa pine; Spotted Owl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955461201

The Cerrado biodiversity hotspot suffers higher deforestation rates than Amazonia and concentrates most of the burned areas in South America. To support adequate fire-management decisions in Cerrado, knowledge on the effects of altered fire regimes upon its animal populations is necessary. Based on a long-term, large-scale fire experiment, we investigated the effects of different fire regimes on the demography of the gymnophthalmid Micrablepharus atticolus, an endemic lizard of the Cerrado. Because M. atticolus is more abundant in open habitats, we predicted that frequent burns should favor its populations. Over eight years, we conducted a mark-recapture study using pitfall trap arrays in five 10 ha plots of cerrado sensu stricto, subjected to prescribed burns. Using generalized linear mixed-models of time series data and an information theoretic approach to select demographic models, we describe the life history of M. atticolus and assess the response of apparent survival, detectability, and recruitment to burn regimes and climate variation. Micrablepharus atticolus has an annual life cycle, with complete annual population turnover; breeding takes place during the dry season, when activity is higher, and hatchlings appear in the wet season. Apparent survival, detectability, and recruitment increased in the short-run after the passage of fire in all experimental plots. In the long run, however, both fire-suppression and more severe fire regimes were seemingly detrimental, presumably by affecting microclimatic conditions and food availability.

In forests of western North America, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides articus) typically colonize burned areas shortly after fire, but densities decline within 6-10 yr. This pattern is often assumed to result from adult Black-backed Woodpeckers abandoning territories when food resources wane, yet long-distance breeding dispersal is relatively rare in birds, whereas long-distance natal dispersal is more common. To determine whether colonization of newly burned areas is driven primarily by breeding dispersal of adults or natal dispersal by young birds, we captured 57 adult Black-backed Woodpeckers in 6 burned areas in California between 1 and 8 yr after fire. We used patterns of multiple feather generations retained among primary coverts, secondaries, and secondary coverts to assign birds to 1 of 5 age classes (second-, third-, and fourth-calendar-year; after-third-calendar-year; and after-fourth-calendar-year). Population age structure varied dramatically across burned areas, with a preponderance of second-calendar-year birds in the 1 yr and 2 yr postfire areas, and a preponderance of birds at least 3 yr old in the older postfire areas. Poisson generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) revealed that the effect of years since fire on woodpecker age was highly significant (z = 3.575, P < 0.001). Our results indicate that natal dispersal is the primary means by which Black-backed Woodpeckers colonize recently burned areas in western forests, and that breeding dispersal is uncommon. The decline of Black-backed Woodpecker populations 6-10 yr after fire likely reflects the lifespan of individual birds that colonized the burned area, or of offspring that they produced in the early postfire years. Our discrimination of Black-backed Woodpeckers into 5 age classes confirms previous suppositions about plumage-based age determination in woodpeckers, and is likely applicable to other woodpecker species. © 2016 American Ornithologists' Union.","Black-backed Woodpecker; breeding dispersal; molt; natal dispersal; Picoides arcticus; population age structure",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951153944

We need a better understanding of how these forests have changed during the fire suppression era, but empirical historical datasets are rare and methodologies for developing new historical reference information are subject to limitations. We sought to develop historical reference information for the Yosemite Forest Dynamics Plot (YFDP), a research plot located in an old-growth mixed-conifer forest in Yosemite National Park. We performed a dendrochronologial fire history analysis to characterize the historical fire regime of the YFDP, resulting in an estimated pre-1900 point fire return interval of 29.5years. We then developed two different forest reconstruction models to estimate structural and compositional forest changes since 1900, the year the last widespread fire burned the YFDP, to the present. We explored the use of two different tree growth models-a regionally parameterized competition-dependent model and a parsimonious site-specific model-as well as a decay model based on published estimates of wood decay rates. The competition-dependent growth model predicted slightly higher stem densities (175 trees ha-1 vs. 112 trees ha-1 in 1900) and slightly lower basal area (20.9m2ha-1 vs. 24.1m2ha-1 in 1900) than the site-specific growth model. Predictions about dead trees, especially large diameter sugar pines, are potentially inaccurate, both in this study and other reconstruction studies in the Sierra Nevada, due to a lack of size-specific snag and log decay rate data. Our study highlights the need for more detailed decay data for Sierra Nevada mixed-conifer forests. While reconstruction models are constrained by the data used to parameterize them, they can still produce estimates of historical conditions that are useful for understanding the direction and magnitude of forest change, as well as for planning forest management. Our analysis demonstrates dramatic changes in forest conditions since fire-exclusion-a clear ecological basis for restoration. We encourage managers to focus on restoring key ecological processes that maintain ecosystem structure and function, in this case fire, rather than attempting tree-for-tree recreations of historical structure without reintroducing fire. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fire history; Pinus lambertiana; Restoration; Sugar pine; Tree decay; Tree growth",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945455286

This is, in part, due to a lack of synthesis of information that is sufficiently contextualized for a policy audience. Here, we identify key species movement concepts, including mechanisms, types, and moderators of movement, and review their relevance to (1) national biodiversity policies and strategies, (2) reserve planning and management, (3) threatened species protection and recovery, (4) impact and risk assessments, and (5) the prioritization of restoration actions. Based on the review, and considering recent developments in movement ecology, we provide a new framework that draws links between aspects of movement knowledge that are likely the most relevant to each biodiversity policy category. Our framework also shows that there is substantial opportunity for collaboration between researchers and government decision makers in the use of movement science to promote positive biodiversity outcomes. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Connectivity; Conservation policy; Decision; Dispersal; Government; Impact assessment; Intervention; Management; Migration; Restoration; Risk assessment; Threatened species; Translocation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84940959362

Ecological successions are still poorly known for saproxylic organisms, particularly in boreal forests. We investigated the use of dead wood as nesting sites for ants along a 60-yr postfire chronosequence in northeastern coniferous forests. We sampled a total of 1,625 pieces of dead wood, in which 263 ant nests were found. Overall, ant abundance increased during the first 30 yr after wildfire, and then declined. Leptothorax cf. canadensis Provancher, the most abundant species in our study, was absent during the first 2 yr postfire, but increased steadily until 30 yr after fire, whereas Myrmica alaskensis Wheeler, second in abundance, was found at all stages of succession in the chronosequence. Six other species were less frequently found, among which Camponotus herculeanus (Linné), Formica neorufibarbis Emery, and Formica aserva Forel were locally abundant, but more scarcely distributed. Dead wood lying on the ground and showing numerous woodborer holes had a higher probability of being colonized by ants. The C:N ratio was lower for dead wood colonized by ants than for noncolonized dead wood, showing that the continuous occupation of dead wood by ants influences the carbon and nitrogen dynamics of dead wood after wildfire in northern boreal forests. © The Authors 2015.

We characterize structural variation, create a hierarchical classification of forest structure, and develop an empirically based framework for conceptualizing structural development from 11,091 plots across 25 million ha of all ownerships in Oregon, Washington, and inland Northern California, USA. A single component related to live tree biomass accounted for almost half of the variation in a principal components analysis of structural attributes, but components related to live tree density and size, dead wood, and understory vegetation together accounted for as much additional variation. These results indicate that structural development is more complex than a monotonic accumulation of live biomass as other components may act independently or emerge at multiple points during development. The classification revealed the diversity of structural conditions expressed at all levels of live biomass depending on the timing and relative importance of a variety of ecological processes (e.g., mortality) in different vegetation zones. Low live biomass structural types (,25 Mg/ha) illustrated the diversity of early-seral conditions and differed primarily in density of live trees and abundance of snags and dead wood. Moderate live biomass structural types (25-99 Mg/ha) differed in tree size and density and generally lacked dead wood, but some structurally diverse types associated with partial stand-replacing disturbance had abundant live and dead legacies. High live biomass structural types (.100 Mg/ha) substantiated the diversity of later developmental stages and exhibited considerable variation in the abundance of dead wood and density of big trees. Most structural types corresponded with previously described stages of development, but others associated with protracted early development, woodland/savannah transitions, and partial stand-replacing disturbance lacked analogs and indicated alternative pathways of development. We propose a conceptual framework that distinguishes among families of pathways depending on the range of variation along different components of structure, the relative importance of different disturbances, and complexity of pathways. Our framework is a starting point for developing more comprehensive models of structural development that apply to a wider variety of vegetation zones differing in environment and disturbance regimes. © 2015 Reilly and Spies.","Disturbance history; Early-seral vegetation; Forest structural development; Live and dead biomass; Logging; Old-growth; Pacific Northwest; Tree density and size; Understory vegetation; Wildfire",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946917203

Given their strong roles in ecosystem dynamics, documenting the response of bird communities to wildfires is important for improving our understanding and management of post-wildfire ecosystems. However, because wildfires are unplanned events, relatively few studies have been conducted to assess local-scale impacts on forest bird communities. In this study, we had the opportunity to use a before-after, control-impact (BACI) approach to assess the response of resident birds to high severity wildfires that occurred in the Lost Pines ecoregion of Texas in September and October 2011. We replicated a previous study using point count surveys to assess summer and winter bird community changes ca. 1. year after the wildfires. We found that total number of detected individuals did not change following the wildfires, but winter bird species richness increased in burned habitat. Changes were apparent at the foraging guild-level for the winter bird community, with an increase in aerial insectivores and decrease in bark insectivores. Summer and winter bird community composition changes were apparent at the species-level and generally agreed with species-specific habitat preferences. For example, species such as eastern bluebirds and chipping sparrows that prefer open woodlands were positively associated with burned habitat. Our results provide quantitative evidence that high severity forest fires increased habitat suitability for many resident bird species. At the landscape-scale, fire-induced increases in habitat heterogeneity could result in higher bird diversity in the Lost Pines ecoregion. We expect bird community composition will be dynamic in the Lost Pines ecoregion over the next few decades as the burned habitat continues to change through successional processes and post-fire management actions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Fire; Loblolly pine; Lost Pines; Texas",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928986199

We used 9 yr of survey data collected at 168 sites to investigate dynamic site occupancy and reproduction in a declining population of California Spotted Owls (Strix occidentalis occidentalis) in southern California, USA. We used multistate models to examine the relationship among owl site occupancy, reproduction, high-severity wildland fire, and postfire logging, while accounting for variation in vegetation characteristics and variation in detectability. Both occupancy and reproduction were positively correlated with successful reproduction in the previous year. Tree cover (ha) in a site's 203-ha core area also was positively correlated with both occupancy and reproduction. We detected no effect of disturbance covariates on reproduction, given that a site was occupied. Fire and logging covariates were both negatively correlated with the probability of site occupancy, and the effect sizes of these disturbances were large in sites that were occupied by owls that were nonreproductive the previous year (reduced 0.19 by fire and 0.26 by postfire logging), but small in sites that were occupied by owls that were reproductive the previous year (reduced 0.02 by fire and 0.03 by postfire logging). This study illustrates the important contribution of consistently occupied and productive breeding sites to this population of Spotted Owls, and demonstrates that both occupancy and reproduction at these productive sites exhibited negligible effects from disturbances.

Using a before-after-control-impact framework, we evaluated the effect of the Quartz Fire on a mixed broadleaf- conifer forest and associated bird community in southwestern Oregon, USA, over 10 yr. To assess whether fire severity explained changes better than simply whether an area was burned, we used a tiered sampling approach by comparing unburned control points with either all burned points combined (burned) or those same points partitioned by severity level (low, moderate, high). As expected, overall tree cover decreased while cover of shrubs increased in response to greater fire severity. This pattern was most pronounced in high-severity areas, where tree cover declined by 40% and remained depressed, but shrub cover recovered from 10% the year following fire to 75% by year 6. Ordinations of bird species density showed turnover in community composition in all burned areas combined, as well as in moderate-severity areas, shifting to a shrub-associated community 9 yr postfire. For individual species, annual density variations were best explained by fire for 14 of 37 species, with fire severity providing the best-fitting model for 7 species.

However, data from remote sensing sources are often used alone as predictors in modelling distributions. Such data will only produce accurate models if features that are distinguishable by remote sensing are a good match to the environmental traits that delineate habitat requirements. Both the Goldcrest Regulus regulus and the Firecrest Regulus ignicapilla respond to complex features of habitats that are not described by simple remote sensing data. We tested the usefulness of remote sensing data as a predictor for two Regulus species according to data from 970 study plots sized 1 × 1 km. Predictors were aggregated using the PCAs and related to the Hayne estimator of species density using GAMs. The models based on both remote sensing data and detailed environmental data proved to be better than the model based only on remote sensing data and/or detailed forest structure data. The Goldcrest reached the highest density in areas with a high share of old spruce-dominated forests with a substantial share of the fir, avoiding the pine, and it preferred forests with a low number of tree species. In turn, the Firecrest favoured old forests, dominated by the spruce and the beech, with an admixture of single old fir and larch trees, avoiding the pine, and preferring forests with a high number of tree species. We suggest using not only free data sources, but also more detailed data containing thorough information on forest inventory derived from ground measurements. © 2015, The Author(s).","Firecrest; Forest stand structure; Goldcrest; Habitat selection; Species’ distribution models",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937641066

To examine how forest structure affects bees we selected 5 stands in each of 7 forest types including: cleared forest; dense young pines; thinned young pines; mature open pine with extensive shrub/sapling cover; mature open pine with extensive herbaceous plant cover and little shrub cover; mature upland hardwood forest; and mature riparian hardwood forest. We sampled bees during the 2008 growing season using pan traps and measured overstory tree density, understory herbaceous plant and shrub diversity and cover, light penetration, and leaf area index. Numbers of bees and numbers of species per plot were highest in cleared forest and in mature pine stands with an herbaceous plant understory. Estimates of asymptotic species richness were highest in mature riparian hardwood forests, cleared forests and open pine forests with an herbaceous plant understory. Bee communities in the cleared forests and in the mature pine with an herbaceous plant understory were grouped together in ordination space which was consistent with perMANOVA results. The best predictor variable for bee species density was total tree basal area which was negatively correlated (r2=0.58), while the best model for predicting bee abundance (r2=0.62) included canopy openness, plant species density (both positively correlated) and shrub cover (negatively correlated). Our results combined with many others show that thinning forests combined with shrub control provides good bee habitat, is compatible with habitat restoration and management for other species, and the resulting forests will be healthier and less susceptible to old (e.g., southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis) and new (European woodwasp, Sirex noctilio) threats. © 2015.","Apoidea; Forest cover; Forest health; Native bees; Pollinator decline; Solitary bees",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928014295

Although the effects of fire on forage availability for deer have been studied, how female deer use burned areas is not well known, particularly as it relates to fire season and the years-since-fire. We used GPS tracking data from 16 adult female white-tailed deer to assess the effects of fire season and years-since-fire on habitat use during summer lactation. Females selected unburned drainages and older (>1. yr-since-fire) burned areas, and avoided recently burned areas. Individuals with a greater percentage of their summer core area burned expanded the size of their summer home range but did not change summer core area size. Furthermore, summer core area site fidelity (i.e., % overlap between 2011 and 2012 core areas) decreased as the percentage of the 2011 summer core area burned in 2012 increased. Female deer increased selection of burned areas as years-since-fire increased, likely because there was a temporary loss of cover immediately following fire with plants slowly regenerating the subsequent growing seasons. Likewise, to avoid areas depleted of cover, females shifted their core areas away from recent burns when possible but increased their core area size when burned areas were unavoidable (i.e., a large portion of their home range was burned). Burning large contiguous areas may initially have a negative effect on female deer during lactation because of the depletion of cover. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Compositional analysis; Cover; Fire-return interval; Longleaf pine; Odocoileus virginianus; Pinus palustris",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928232750

Specifically, (1) the effect of fire on any one species is context dependent. It depends on the time since the fire, the fire severity, and vegetation type and condition. (2) Bird species respond differently to any given postfire condition and, given an appropriate time since the fire and postfire vegetation conditions, most benefit from severe fire. (3) Some bird species (the black-backed woodpecker being iconic) seem to depend on conditions created by severe fire, as evidenced by their distribution patterns, territory sizes, nest success, and other adaptations. (4) Given these facts, current management practices designed to prevent fire, suppress fire, mitigate fire severity, ""restore"" or ""rehabilitate"" burned forests after fire, and mimic the effects of severe fire are incompatible with the maintenance of bird populations and, therefore, ecosystem integrity. © 2015 by Dominick A.

Outbreaks of bark beetles create habitat heterogeneity in forests that can benefit numerous wildlife species. While important questions remain, the best available science indicates that outbreaks of bark beetles do not increase the risk of high-severity fires in lodgepole pine and spruce-fir forests of the Rocky Mountains. Furthermore, the effects of outbreaks are much less important to fire risk than are weather and climate. By contrast, severe wildfires can reduce subsequent susceptibility to outbreaks in both forest types, although the modulating effect of fires on susceptibility to outbreaks may be contingent on current and future climate influences on beetle populations and tree resistances. The current state of knowledge does not support the common assumption that increases in bark beetle activity have resulted in increased wildfire activity. Therefore policy discussions should focus on societal adaptation to the effects of the underlying driving factor of increased tree mortality from insects and from burning: climate warming. © 2015 by Dominick A.

In heavily burned forests, more insect prey is available for bats, and seeds and sprouting plants feed small mammals. Vegetation re-growth after intense fire produces highly palatable browse for elk, mule deer, and bighorn sheep. Standing dead trees provide cover for deer in severely burned forests, whereas bighorn sheep can more easily perceive predators in heavily burned chaparral. Mesocarnivores, including foxes, martens, and fishers, often are detected in forests that burned intensely.

Stand-replacing fire disturbances are under-appreciated natural events that have been shaping fire-dependent ecosystems for millennia, and their ecosystem benefits are being compromised by management actions that carry unintended consequences. Mimicking the spatial, temporal, and structural heterogeneity of these fire effects through management is not possible. Moreover, fire management actions such as forest thinning, mastication, and postfire logging are creating novel fire regimes at the expense of historical ones. Dramatic improvements in fire management and public perceptions of wildfire are needed to accommodate wildfires where they are beneficial.

The diverse array of organisms that inhabit stream-riparian ecosystems respond to wildfire across a gradient of fire severity. In addition, time since fire and annual timing of fires can interact with other sources of disturbance and life-history events to influence stream-riparian systems across levels of ecological organization. The degree of impact wildfire has also depends on spatial aspects, including extent and patchiness, as well as interactions with anthropogenic disturbance. For example, if characteristic stream-riparian continuity is disrupted or other natural features are impaired or lost as a result of human activities, detrimental effects can occur. In general, stream-riparian organisms are highly adapted to natural disturbance processes, and the occurrence of dynamic, mixed-severity fire regimes may be necessary to maintain ecological integrity and native biodiversity. © 2015 by Dominick A.

They consist of varying fire-patch severities, including large (> 1000 ha) high-severity patches of complex early seral habitat for pyrophilous (fire-seeking) species. Megafires produce high levels of beta diversity (species turnover across gradients) via landscape heterogeneity and high alpha (site-level) diversity via a pulse of keystone structures, such as large snags and downed logs and native shrub patches. Longer time lines are needed to fully understand megafire effects, particularly in a changing climate that in some places may begin to close overall fire deficits. New policies are needed to place high-quality postfire landscapes created by megafires on par with other biodiverse areas. Regional conservation planning should view megafires as a restorative agent for at-risk fire-dependent communities rather than ecologically destructive. © 2015 by Dominick A. DellaSala and Chad T.

Whereas recent nest web studies greatly increased our understanding of nest tree use by woodpeckers, knowledge on woodpeckers foraging requirements is much less developed. We quantified and compared tree selection patterns and foraging behavior of six bark-foraging woodpeckers - downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), American three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), yellow-bellied sapsucker (Sphyropicus varius) and pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) - that co-occur in eastern boreal forests of North America. A total of 271 observation bouts and more than 600 foraging trees were recorded at three study sites characterized as mixedwood, conifer, and burn. Our results show that dead wood represents an important foraging substrate for most bark-foraging woodpeckers in Canadian eastern boreal forests. However, significant differences in individual species were found with regard to substrate use patterns, foraging behavior and associated prey. Woodpeckers were categorized according to their selection for specific stages of tree degradation, with the yellow-bellied sapsucker and the pileated woodpecker representing opposite ends of this gradient. The black-backed woodpecker showed the highest use of dead wood and was very specific in its tree selection by using mostly recently dead trees. We emphasize that providing foraging substrates for most woodpecker species not only requires maintaining dead wood but also paying heed to the underlying dynamics of dead wood (e.g. recruitment and degradation) in managed boreal forest landscapes. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Boreal forest; Dead wood; Foraging; Picoides; Saproxylic; Woodpeckers",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84924663658

However, the effects of interactions between bark beetle outbreaks and subsequent wildfires on forest succession remain poorly understood. We collected data in dry mixed conifer forests across Idaho and western Montana to test whether vegetation responses differ between sites experiencing single and repeated disturbances. We compared tree seedling density and age, surface fuel loading, and stand structure characteristics in stands that experienced either high severity wildfire, large-scale tree mortality from bark beetles, or stands that experienced high bark beetle mortality followed by severe wildfire within 3-8 years of attack. Tree seedling density was 300-400% higher in gray bark beetle-affected stands than burned sites, but there was no evidence that a beetle and wildfire interaction affected seedling densities. The age distribution of Douglas-fir and grand fir seedlings in stands with repeated disturbances differed from those that only experienced wildfire, suggesting that seed availability varies between these stands. Though both bark beetle outbreaks and wildfires resulted in the death of numerous large trees and surface woody fuel loads 100-200% greater than control sites, the creation of large snags and higher fuel loads across the landscape may have ecological benefits. Compounding effects of bark beetle activity and wildfires were not observed in surface fuel loadings or stand densities. Overall, the effects of high severity wildfire drove post-disturbance fuel complexes and succession whereas the effects of Dendroctonus pseudotsugae and Dendroctonus brevicomis outbreaks before wildfires resulted in minimal post-wildfire differences. We conclude that although seedling age structure is responsive to bark beetle and fire interactions, in terms of fuel complexes and tree densities these disturbances are non-additive and compounding effects on forest trajectory of dry mixed conifer forests of the northern Rockies were not supported. © 2015 Stevens-Rumann et al.","Bark beetle and fire interactions; Dendroctonus brevicomis; Dendroctonus pseudotsugae; Dry mixed conifer forests; Northwestern usa; Repeated disturbances; Wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939136192

While not uncommon for prescriptions to include repeated burning at short fire return intervals, long-term frequent fire effects in hardwood forests have rarely been quantified. We describe the effects of over 60. years of repeated prescribed burning on stand structure and composition in a Missouri Ozark oak-hickory forest. Data were collected in 2010 and 2013 from 40. ×. 40. m plots arranged in a randomized complete block design with two blocks and three treatments: an unburned control (Control), annual prescribed fire (Annual; one-year fire return interval), and periodic prescribed fire (Periodic; four-year fire return interval). In 2013, the diameter distribution of the Control was an exponential decay, whereas those in both burn treatments were unimodal. Repeated prescribed burning, especially at four-year fire return intervals, reduced overstory density and canopy cover and shifted overstory composition from a mixture of white oak species, red oak species, and hickories to primarily white oak species. Although small-diameter stems were top-killed on Periodic plots, resprouting created a dense mid-story of small stature saplings. In contrast, Annual plots were virtually void of woody seedlings and saplings. There was no apparent tree recruitment on either Annual or Periodic plots. The abundance, richness, diversity, and evenness of the understory plant community were greater on the burned plots than on the Control plots, with forbs dominating the Annual plots and woody species dominating the Control plots. Periodic plots included a mixture of forbs and woody species, and graminoids were not common in any plots. Understory species richness per square meter was nearly three times greater on both burn treatments relative to the Control. Our results indicate that long-term, repeated prescribed burning can approximate woodland conditions. However, the lack of tree recruitment suggests that periods without fire are critical for replacing overstory trees. Moreover, additional treatments such as mechanical thinning may be important for modifying the understory environment to benefit graminoids or for reaching management objectives on desirable timescales. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Floristic diversity; Frequent fire; Long-term fire effects; Oak regeneration; Woodland restoration",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923875567

We used Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis) as a surrogate species to measure the relative importance of local vegetation and large-scale habitat distribution in the Onslow Bight region of North Carolina, USA. We conducted repeated point counts at 232 points within 111 habitat patches between April 10 and July 20, 2011.

We documented a strong response to vegetation characteristics best maintained via prescribed fire, but the most influential predictor of Bachman's Sparrow occupancy was the amount of habitat within 3 km.

Forest edges have been well studied in temperate and tropical forests, but less so in less productive, disturbance-adapted boreal forests. We synthesized data on forest vegetation at edges of boreal forests and compared edge influence among edge types (fire, cut, lake/wetland; old vs. young), forest types (broadleaf vs. coniferous) and geographic regions. Our objectives were to quantify vegetation responses at edges of all types and to compare the strength and extent of edge influence among different types of edges and forests. Research was conducted using the same general sampling design in Alberta, Ontario and Quebec in Canada, and in Sweden and Finland. We conducted a meta-analysis for a variety of response variables including forest structure, deadwood abundance, regeneration, understorey abundance and diversity, and non-vascular plant cover. We also determined the magnitude and distance of edge influence (DEI) using randomization tests. Some edge responses (lower tree basal area, tree canopy and bryophyte cover; more logs; higher regeneration) were significant overall across studies. Edge influence on ground vegetation in boreal forests was generally weak, not very extensive (DEI usually < 20 m) and decreased with time. We found more extensive edge influence at natural edges, at younger edges and in broadleaf forests. The comparison among regions revealed weaker edge influence in Fennoscandian forests. Synthesis. Edges created by forest harvesting do not appear to have as strong, extensive or persistent influence on vegetation in boreal as in tropical or temperate forested ecosystems. We attribute this apparent resistance to shorter canopy heights, inherent heterogeneity in boreal forests and their adaptation to frequent natural disturbance. Nevertheless, notable differences between forest structure responses to natural (fire) and anthropogenic (cut) edges raise concerns about biodiversity implications of extensive creation of anthropogenic edges. By highlighting universal responses to edge influence in boreal forests that are significant irrespective of edge or forest type, and those which vary by edge type, we provide a context for the conservation of boreal forests.

A key habitat component within Australian forest ecosystems are hollow-bearing trees which are crucially important for fauna species requiring tree hollows for diurnal shelter and nesting. The effect of disturbance regimes, in particular logging and fire, on hollow dynamics is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to determine the relationships between logging intensity and fire frequency on hollow abundance and forest stand structural attributes in two different eastern Australian Eucalyptus forest types.We found that average stand tree diameter at breast height was negatively correlated to logging intensity. Logging intensity was negatively correlated with tree diameter at breast height (DBH), and the density of both hollow-bearing trees and hollows. Losses of hollow-bearing trees and hollows occurred through an interaction between logging intensity and fire frequency, resulting in an absence of recruitment of hollow trees. However in unlogged forest, fire was positively correlated to the density of hollows. Under a regime of frequent fire, in areas that have had some degree of logging activity, a net loss of hollows may occur. We recommend additional hollow recruitment trees be retained on logged sites in the future if no net losses of hollows are to occur in the future, or for wider unlogged buffers to be established adjacent to the cutting area. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Australia; Eucalyptus; Fire; Logging; Tree hollows",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84921453522

Riparian areas may affect fire behavior and the pattern of burning due to saturated soils and patchy fuels that may have high moisture content in live and dead stems. We examined the effects of a severe fire on the dominant riparian vegetation: thin-leaf alder, river birch and willow, in a broad riparian valley in Rocky Mountain National Park, CO, USA. We mapped the canopy stem mortality and basal resprouting of 4507 first year post fire and 643 second year post fire individuals that had been the dominant woody canopy. To examine the effect of herbivory on resprouting willow stems, we established a paired experiment with 22 willows exclosed in cages to prevent browsing and 22 uncaged control plants. Aerial seed rain sticky traps were established on transects throughout the study area and pre-fire seed rain density was compared with post-fire seed rain densities.Fire effects on willow were severe, with 91% of individuals having complete canopy loss. Fifty-one percent of thin-leaf alder individuals and 71% of river birch individuals also had complete canopy loss. Seventy-four percent of river birch, 45% of willow and 35% of thin-leaf alder resprouted from the base in the first summer post fire. In the second year post fire, 84% of river birch, 62% of thin-leaf alder and 55% of willow had resprouted. Willows inside exclosures had greater biomass at the end of the growing season compared with willows outside exclosures.

Post-fire aerial seed rain was 90% lower than pre-fire densities.Fire dramatically altered the riparian vegetation. Willow seed rain was nearly eliminated because most stems were killed by fire.

With arguably the most unusual lepidopteran life history on earth, larvae grow to 100. mm, spending ~6. years as wood-boring parasites feeding on host tree phloem. Parasite fitness is a product of host suitability. Parasite discrimination between heterogeneous hosts in fragmented populations shapes parasite aggregation. We investigated whether A. virescens aggregation among hosts occurs randomly (target area effect), or if larvae select hosts based on host quality (ideal free distribution). Using long-term larval growth as an indicator of energy intake, we examined A. virescens aggregation in relation to host size and infra-population. Using a generalised linear model, the relationship between parasite intensity and host tree size was analysed. Reduced major axis regression was used to evaluate A. virescens growth after 1. year. Linear mixed-effects models inferred the influence of parasite infra-population on parasite growth, with host tree as a random factor. Results indicate parasite intensity scaled positively with host size. Furthermore, parasite growth remained consistent throughout ontogeny regardless of host size or parasite infra-population. Aenetus virescens aggregation among hosts violates the ideal free distribution hypothesis, occurring instead as a result of host size, supporting the target area effect. © 2014 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.","Host-parasite interaction; Ideal free distribution; Lepidoptera; New Zealand; Target area effect; Wood-borer",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925062775

Several tactics are available to manage bark beetle infestations and to reduce associated levels of tree mortality. Direct control involves short-term tactics designed to address current infestations by manipulating beetle populations, and typically includes the use of fire, insecticides, semiochemicals, sanitation harvests, or a combination of these treatments. Indirect control is preventive and designed to reduce the probability and severity of future infestations within treated areas by manipulating stand, forest and/or landscape conditions by reducing the number of susceptible hosts through thinning, prescribed burning, and/or altering age classes and species composition.

Number of cavity openings and height of lowest limb differed significantly between open limb and cavity roosts (Mann-Whitney U test, P < 0.05). The spotted owlets used larger trees with a wider basal circumference and canopy volume for open limbs, while roost height, diameter at breast height, total limbs, number cavity openings, and height of lowest limb were larger in cavity roosts. The roost trees were closer to human settlements than other habitat types. Based on our results, we concluded that the spotted owlets preferred roost trees closer to foraging areas and large tree with dense canopy because the roosts located in larger trees are protected from sunlight exposure and provide cover from predators. © 2015 Istituto per lo Studio degli Ecosistemi of the Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Firenze.","cavity roosts; habitats; India; Madurai; open limb roosts; spotted owlet",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923842413

The present study was conducted in central Quebec within coniferous forests shaped largely by timber harvest and wildfire. The objectives were to compare the age composition of breeding black-backed woodpeckers, nest survival rate and productivity in both disturbed and undisturbed habitats (respectively recently burned and unburned habitats). In addition, we evaluated the general productivity of both habitat types in a simulated boreal landscape. There was a positive relationship between nest age and daily survival rates. Older woodpeckers were the most abundant breeders in unburned habitats and younger birds in oneyear-old burns. Although nests in recently burned forests produced more nestlings per successful nest, our simulation of a boreal forest landscape showed that unburned habitat produced about two-thirds more fledglings per year than burned habitat. Globally, unburned habitat may provide woodpeckers more temporally stable resources. Population dynamics of the black-backed woodpecker, at least in our study area, may be explained by resource pulse interactions where populations benefit opportunistically from short-term high-quality habitat, and rely on unburned habitats for long-term persistence. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.","age-class structure; nest survival; Picoides arcticus; resource pulse interactions; wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84975455037

Past studies have focused on nest site selection and survival but information is needed on factors influencing their space use when away from the nest. We examined space use by white-headed woodpeckers during the nesting (May-Jul) and post-nesting (Jul-Oct) periods and compared the role of environmental factors (e.g., landcover) and socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, breeding success) in home range size and selection of location. Average size of 99% kernel home ranges was 125 ha (SD ± 59 ha; n = 19) in the nesting period and 137 ha (SD ± 70 ha; n = 30) in the post-nesting period. Minimum convex polygons were generally comparable to or smaller than ranges reported from previous radio-telemetry studies with this species. Although bird weight and age best explained variation in home range size compared to other factors, neither parameter estimate was significant in our models. Thus, even though weight and age were the most-supported factors in our analysis, home range size was largely influenced by factors that we did not measure. We found that most woodpeckers selected home ranges within forest patches that had undergone a recent disturbance; these areas included forests that had recently been burned with prescribed fire by the United States Forest Service (82%) or subject to disease (16%). Most burned patches in our study were small (approx. 4.8 ha) and occurred within otherwise live forest but had nearly complete mortality of adult trees. We suggest that recent forest disturbances, especially mixed-severity prescribed burns, may have been selected by white-headed woodpeckers because they created snags for nesting and future studies should explore this hypothesis. Because home range size was variable and not linked with productivity, it should not be used as an indication of habitat quality without more detailed studies on causal factors that affect space use in this species. © Published 2015.

A key function of the LLPE is the provisioning of food for wildlife. Despite the plethora of literature evaluating the effects of fire season and fire-return interval on plant community dynamics, little attention has been given to the response of wildlife foods to fire season or fire-return interval. We measured the availability of key wildlife foods (fleshy fruit [i.e., seed containing a nutritious pericarp] and understory plant biomass) in upland pine forest following dormant-season (December–February) and growing-season (April–June) fires in a chronosequential design. Also, we quantified the relative contributions of the upland hardwood and bottomland hardwood forest types, which often are intentionally suppressed in the LLPE. In 2011 and 2012, we measured understory leafy biomass, biomass of forages selected by whitetailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus Zimm.), and soft mast production chronosequentially in relation to years-since-fire, fire season, and vegetation type in the LLPE at Fort Bragg Military Installation, North Carolina, USA. Understory leafy biomass increased in upland pine and hardwood forests as years-since-fire increased until two years post fire. Selected forages decreased in upland pine forest and increased in upland hardwood forest as time-since-fire increased. In upland pine forests burned during the growing season, 94 % of the fruit was detected two years after fire, 6 % one year after fire, and 0 % the same year as fire. In June, fruit density was greatest in bottomland hardwood forest; in July, fruit density was great each month) was greatest in upland hardwood forest. Understory leafy biomass and deer-selected forages were stable in bottomland hardwood forest because they were not burned, thereby providing a relatively high and stable availability from year to year. Our data demonstrate the importance of diversity in fire season and frequency, and diversity in vegetation types to promote key wildlife foods in the LLPE. © 2015, Association for Fire Ecology.

The availability of food resources may be a particularly strong determinant of habitat quality for irruptive bird species. We studied the apparent foraging success of Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), an irruptive species that responds opportunistically to pulsed food resources in burned forests and mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations. Prior investigations revealed that the highest population growth rates of Black-backed Woodpeckers occurred in habitat created by summer wildfire, with intermediate population growth rates in MPB infestations, and the lowest population growth rates in habitats created by prescribed fire in fall. We tested whether apparent foraging success was associated with known habitat quality in order to assess the potential for food availability to regulate population growth. We counted the number of successfully captured wood-boring beetle larvae and ""small"" prey on each tree that a Blackbacked Woodpecker used for foraging and modeled these counts as a function of habitat, tree diameter, number of years postfire, and tree disturbance category. Total apparent foraging success (the sum of observed captures of woodboring beetle larvae and small prey per tree) did not vary across habitats, but woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by summer wildfire were expected to capture 2.2 and 2.0 times more wood-boring beetles than woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations, respectively. These results suggest that the availability of food resources may contribute to population regulation in this irruptive species. Furthermore, population growth in irruptive species may be highly sensitive to the availability of preferred food resources. Forests recently burned by summer wildfires provide relatively abundant food resources for Black-backed Woodpeckers and represent high-quality habitat for this species of conservation concern. © 2015 Cooper Ornithological Society.","Bark beetles; Disturbance; Ephemeral habitat; Foraging; Wood-boring beetles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928108072

We used a before-After control-impact experiment to examine avian responses to prescribed fire at two scales in topographically variable, tall-open eucalypt forest in south-east Australia. We surveyed birds at control and impact areas twice before and twice after fire, and applied mixed models to investigate responses of avian turnover, richness and the occurrence of selected species. Approximately half of the impact area was burnt and topographic variation generated a finger-like configuration of burnt patches on ridges and unburnt patches in gullies. Our findings at the smaller scale (0.8ha) indicated that the fire resulted in increased bird diversity because a patchwork of burnt and unburnt areas provided a mosaic of distinct successional states in which different species occurred. Additionally, we found that the effect of fire on species richness and occurrence was a function of the presence of unburnt topographic refuges. In contrast, we found no compelling evidence to suggest that birds responded to the fire at the larger scale (400ha). We conclude that application of low-severity fire in a patchy manner enhanced avian diversity and facilitated the persistence of the birds detected in pre-fire surveys. Although the levels of patchiness required to sustain diverse taxa warrant further study, our findings highlight the importance of formally incorporating patchiness into prescribed burning for the ecologically sensitive management of contemporary landscapes.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941279202

An assessment was conducted of the quality of northern goshawk nesting and foraging habitat, along with the habitat quality of 22 of the goshawk’s prey species. A Delphi (expert panel) evaluation of goshawk and prey habitat in 3,414 watersheds averaging 449 acres (182 ha) in size was completed by wildlife biologists from the Black Hills National Forest. The quality of goshawk nesting and foraging habitat and of prey group habitats was reported individually, then combined for each watershed. The optimum goshawk and prey habitat, totaling 67 watersheds or 34,427 acres (13,932 ha), was distributed throughout the nearly 1.5 million-acre (about 607,000-ha) Black Hills National Forest. Panel members found that the Bear Lodge Mountains, located in northeastern Wyoming, proportionally had the most optimum, high-, and medium-rated habitat. Wildfire, bark beetles, urban encroachment, and timber harvest can negatively affect northern goshawks and their prey’s habitat. However, increasing the amount and presence of quaking aspen forests within the Black Hills will most likely improve the habitat of the goshawk by improving the habitat for many of its prey.

Latitude and percent tree stocking had a negative relationship with occupancy (coefficients and 95% credible intervals: -1.07 [CI: -1.63, -0.67] and -0.63 [CI: -0.97, -0.350]). The density of recently killed and well-decayed snags had positive associations with occupancy (coefficients and 95% credible intervals: 0.57 [CI: 0.17, 1.16] and 0.37 [CI: 0.05, 0.72]). Neither grassy herbaceous cover nor percent of stocking in pine were associated with occupancy. We found that restoration efforts created suitable stand structure for brown-headed nuthatches, but many restored sites in the range-extension zone appeared to be vacant. Occupied habitats in the range-extension zone had fewer snags, less frequent fire, and more shrub cover than occupied sites where the species was established. Release from conspecific competition may have permitted nuthatches in the range-extension zone to exploit habitats that would otherwise have been marginal. Alternatively, nuthatches may be restricted to such sites although there are more suitable sites tens of kilometers away. Experimental translocations and reintroductions could determine how habitat structure and nuthatch density affect the quality of restored sites in the range-extension zone and enable those sites to achieve their biodiversity potential.

In Louisiana, two fertilization levels (No or Yes [36 kg/ha nitrogen and 40 kg/ha phosphorus]) in combination with three vegetation treatments (check, five prescribed fires [PFs], or multiyear vegetation control [IVM]) were applied to longleaf pine plantings established in a randomized complete block factorial design (α = 0.05). After 12 years, survival averaged 61% across the six-treatment combinations. Fertilization did not affect longleaf pine growth or stand production, and thus, native fertility was not limiting pine development. Longleaf pine bolewood production was significantly greater on IVM plots (165 m 3/ha) than on check and PF plots (average of 113 m3/ha). In the 13th growing season, IVM plots had significantly less understory tree cover (51%) than checks (80%), but PF plots had the least tree cover (16%) and the most grass (5%) and forb (10%) cover. Fertilization significantly increased understory tree cover (58%) compared with that for unfertilized plots (40%), but woody vine cover was significantly less on fertilized plots (3%) than on unfertilized plots (6%). © 2015, Forest Science.

To address this knowledge gap we documented apparent changes in the diversity and abundance of lichens following 0 to 2 growing-season burns preceded by 0 to 1 commercial thinnings within nine southern pine dominated stands on the Delmarva Peninsula of Maryland, USA. Corticolous lichens growing on the stems and within the canopies of pines and co-occurring hardwoods were identified to species and fractional coverage was estimated; growth forms and reproductive modes were also determined. A total of 93 lichen taxa were recorded on the 19 tree species (4 pines, 15 hardwoods) represented in this study. Burning emerged as a strong driver of reductions in lichen diversity (P = 0.002), whereas thinning in the absence of burning did not (P = 0.279). In general, we found that lichens growing on tree bases and lower bole sections were more strongly impacted by burning, both in terms of diversity and cover, than those residing in the canopy. The apparent refugia represented by the canopy was qualified by the limited overlap in lichen species composition observed among the various sampling heights. This work calls attention to an understudied component of biodiversity that appears to be sensitive to fire management; however, we suggest that these results need to be interpreted in the context of altered disturbance regimes and the trajectory of community assembly resulting from long-term fire exclusion. © 2015, Association for Fire Ecology.

Estimates drawn from the literature suggest that lightning directly or indirectly kills up to 4% of large canopy trees in a stand annually. Lightning is a major cause of death for pines in southeastern US forests and for large cacti in some deserts, but its landscape-level effects exclusive of fire at higher latitudes are poorly known. We quantified damage to trees from lightning and other sources in hemlock–hardwood forests of the Huron Mountain Region of Michigan, USA. This region receives ca. 100 cloud-to-ground lightning flashes per year, with most occurring in May to August. We recorded abiotic and biotic damage on 309 trees distributed among nine transects, each >2 km long. None of the transect trees had lightning scars, and we observed only 14 clear cases of lightning damage among thousands of trees examined during associated meander surveys (each ca. 0.5 ha). This damage was more commonly associated with emergent stature (50% of struck trees) and higher rates of biotic damage (50%) than we observed in the 309 transect trees (22% emergent status and 16% incidence of biotic damage). Nearly all (93%) of the lightning damaged trees were conifers, suggesting that either susceptibility to, or response to, lightning strikes has a phylogenetic basis. These preliminary results provide a foundation for comparative studies in other forests. Accurate quantification of lightning-induced tree mortality will improve forest turnover models and facilitate predictions of future forest structure under conditions of increased lightning frequency. ©, 2015, National Research Council of Canada.

Although research in green, unburned forests has identified the influence of different excavators on secondary use by cavity-dependent species, little is known about the relative importance of cavities created by woodpeckers in recently burned forests. By excavating cavities, woodpeckers create habitat for secondary cavity users that can facilitate post-fire regeneration through seed dispersal, seed germination and regulation of insect populations that affect vegetative growth. In this study, we monitored 77 cavities created by three species of Picoides woodpeckers for use by secondary cavity species in a fire that burned in the Sierra Nevada, California. At each cavity we measured nest tree and site-specific parameters to determine if these characteristics could explain differential use by secondary cavity users. We found substantial overlap in cavity characteristics between woodpecker species, with the white-headed woodpecker differing most notably in their placement of cavities in larger diameter, shorter and more decayed trees in less dense stands than either hairy or black-backed woodpeckers. These differences in cavity placement may have resulted in the high diversity and large number of detections of secondary cavity species in white-headed woodpecker cavities. Black-backed and hairy woodpeckers were similar in the number of detections of secondary cavity use, although black-backed woodpecker cavities were used by more species than hairy woodpecker cavities. Secondary cavity use was high (86%) suggesting these woodpeckers, and the white-headed woodpecker in particular, can have an accelerating affect effect on ecological succession by providing valuable habitat features for seed dispersing birds and mammals, insectivorous birds, and small predators, thereby impacting ecological processes and functions. © 2015 The Zoological Society of London.","Burn severity; Community dynamics; Community ecology; Ecological succession; Pioneer species; Post-fire habitat",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84930378117

Many snake species use open early successional habitats for basking (thermoregulation) and foraging, but individual species within an assemblage vary in their requirements. Consequently, management to maintain early successional habitats using prescribed fire may have varied effects on different species. We used a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) experimental design to explore how a snake assemblage responded to a prescribed burn intended to improve habitat quality for the endangered Eastern Massasauga Rattlesnake, Sistrurus catenatus catenatus, in an old field habitat in New York. Although we do not employ full statistical analysis given that the fire treatment was operationally applied only to one site, our results suggest that prescribed fire is an important influence of habitat quality for snakes.

We surveyed breeding bird species in 2012 and 2013 and modeled species-specific occupancy in relation to habitat variables. Several species, including the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus), downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), Bewick's wren (Thryomanes bewickii), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), dickcissel (Spiza americana), and orchard oriole (Icterus spurius) were associated with lower levels of tree density or canopy cover (i.e., savanna-woodland). Species associated with greater levels of tree density or canopy cover at some spatial scale included eastern wood-pewee (Contopus virens), white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), blue-gray gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), and indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea). Occupancy of eastern wood-pewee and blue grosbeak (Passerina caerulea) were highest at intermediate levels of canopy cover (50-m radius) and tree density, respectively. Occupancies of eastern wood-pewee, northern mockingbird, lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus), indigo bunting, and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were variously related to shrub density, which was unrelated to tree cover or density across the savanna-forest gradient.

Moreover, as the time of exposure to fire is related to stand productivity, combining information on productivity and fire should help in assessing the potential to sustainably manage forests. We present a method to assess potential vulnerability to the risk of fire and illustrate it in the boreal coniferous forest of Quebec. This method takes into account some sources of uncertainty related to the estimation of productivity and fire risk. Spatialization of stand productivity from growth and yield curves allowed us to compute the area comprised of productive stands of each district with or without considering fire risk. Results showed that productive area is generally decreasing with decreasing degree-days, increasing elevation, or in relation to surficial geology. Furthermore, districts with moderate to good productivity were found to be vulnerable to fire when burn rates were greater than 0.333%·year–1. Our innovative approach allowed us to assess the vulnerability of the districts to fire and could be helpful in many regions in the context of a projected increase in future area burned under climate change. © 2015, Canadian Journal of Forest Research.

Fortunately, natural resource professionals have recognized the importance of restoring these ecologically important forests that support a diversity of native flora and fauna. Although efforts are underway to restore longleaf pine savannas, little information exists on Eastern wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo silvestris) reproductive ecology within these systems. Therefore, we used radio telemetry to investigate Eastern wild turkey reproductive ecology in 2 longleaf pine-dominated forests in southwestern Georgia during 2011-2013. Forty-two percent of nests (n= 78) were successful (≥1 egg hatched) with most nest loss resulting from predation. Five nests were exposed to prescribed fire events (2 were successful; 3 were unsuccessful). Thirty-seven percent of females renested following loss to predation, fire, or other factors. Of these, 43% successfully hatched (≥1 egg hatched). We monitored 34 broods post-hatch. Of the 34 broods, 11 (32%) survived the 14-day flightless period. Of the remaining 11 broods, 7 (64%) survived the following 2-week period (i.e., days 15-30). One of 34 broods was lost to growing-season prescribed fire during the study. Females frequently selected nest sites in areas at the end of their burn rotation (i.e., prior to the next scheduled burn; x-= 613.7. days since burn for all nests from nest initiation date; SE. = 44.7. days). Habitat characteristics at the nest-site and patch-level had little influence on nest survival, suggesting that once a nest site is chosen, nest predation occurs randomly with respect to habitat characteristics. In addition, timing of nest initiation did not significantly improve nest survival. Management of longleaf pine savannas should focus on applying prescribed fire every 1-2. years to maintain native flora communities while enhancing nest and brood cover. Our results also indicate that growing-season prescribed fire has minimal impact on wild turkey production. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Brood survival; Georgia; Growing-season fire; Meleagris gallopavo silvestris; Nest survival; Pinus palustris",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84906861318

Because the practice of restoration utilizes many techniques common to silviculture, no clear line separates ordinary forestry practices from restoration. The distinction may be that extra-ordinary activities are required in the face of degraded, damaged, or destroyed ecosystems. Restoration is driven by the desire to increase sustainability of ecosystems and their services and restoration is likely to have multiple goals arising from the motivations of those involved. The process of setting restoration objectives translates vague goals into feasible, measurable targets and ultimately actions on the ground. Our objective for this review is to synthesize the science underpinning contemporary approaches to forest restoration practice. We focus on methods and present them within a coherent terminology of four restoration strategies: rehabilitation, reconstruction, reclamation, and replacement. While not a consensus terminology, these terms have a logical foundation. Rehabilitation restores desired species composition, structure, or processes to a degraded ecosystem. Reconstruction restores native plant communities on land recently in other resource uses, such as agriculture. Reclamation restores severely degraded land generally devoid of vegetation, often the result of resource extraction, such as mining. Replacement of species (or their locally-adapted genotypes) with new species (or new genotypes) is a response to climate change. Restoration methods are presented as available tools; because adding vegetation is an effective restoration technique, the discussion of methods begins with a description of available plant materials. We then discuss altering composition under different initial overstory conditions, including deployment methods depending upon whether or not an overstory is present, how much of the landscape will be restored, and the complexity of the planting design. We present some major approaches for altering structure in degraded forest stands, and describe approaches for restoration of two key ecosystem processes, fire and flooding. Although we consider stand-level designs, what we describe is mostly scalable to the landscape-level. No restoration project is undertaken in a social vacuum; even stand-level restoration occurs within a system of governance that regulates relationships among key agents. Gathering information and understanding the social dimensions of a restoration project is as necessary as understanding the biophysical dimensions. Social considerations can trump biophysical factors. © 2014.","Ecological restoration; Forest landscape restoration; Reclamation; Reconstruction; Rehabilitation; Replacement",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85027958302

While much is known about boreal wildfires, the focus on forest remnants that either escape or survive these intense fires is a recent phenomenon: academics now study ecological processes of wildfire residuals, forest policymakers use their patterns to design harvest strategies, forest managers consider their economic value, and conservationists recognize their intrinsic ecological importance. Ecology of Wildfire Residuals in Boreal Forests is the first book to explore ecological patterns and processes of what does not burn within boreal wildfires. Following a brief introduction to the boreal forest biome, it discusses the processes that form wildfire residuals; how they are studied, with various approaches and methods; the types, extent, and ecological functions of wildfire residuals; and their role in forest management applications, all in the context of ecological scale. This book is a reference for researchers and graduate students studying boreal forest ecology, as well as for policymakers and forest managers. It adopts a non-reductionist perspective that will be of interest to scientists from conservation science, forest ecology, forest management, and timber production. • Brings together fire behaviour, ecological scale, vegetation ecology, and conservation biology to provide a cross disciplinary, multi-scale, and an integrative discussion of forest fire residuals • Captures the state of knowledge with a meta-analysis of research trends during the past few decades, with a comprehensive review of the literature, a compilation of key references, and a list of key topics relevant to the study of boreal wildfire residuals • Identifies the major gaps and uncertainties in the present body of knowledge, including a critique of study techniques and reporting practices to date, and proposes a set of terms and definitions and a list of research questions and priorities • Includes the authors' observations and research experience from boreal Canada, and information extracted from interactions with North American and European ecologists, forest managers, and conservationists. © 2014 by by Ajith H.

I developed a conceptual model explaining the persistence of cavity-nesting birds on the landscape after fires depending on carrying capacity (food supply) of the habitat and the philopatry and territoriality of the species. The breeding density, nest site characteristics, and reproductive success of Northern Flickers Colaptes auratus was studied before and after low- to moderate-severity fires on replicated plots. The density and spatial distribution of nests did not change in a consistent way after fires, but the rates of cavity excavation increased and characteristics of nest sites changed as such decay class of the tree. Laying dates were delayed and clutches were smaller in freshly excavated vs. reused cavities on the burned sites. Breeding philopatry caused a shift to older age classes in the population. Depredation of nests by small mammals increased during the first three years after fires, reducing the number of young produced per nest attempt on burned plots. The study shows that, even when fire does not reduce the density of breeding pairs, there may be detrimental effects detected only by monitoring the behavior and reproduction of individuals. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.","British Columbia; Canada; Cavity nesters; Colaptes auratus; Fire; Nest density; Reproductive success; Riske Creek; Wildfire; Woodpecker",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907222738

In 2002-2005, stresses from drought, changes in the fire regime, and increases in forest density contributed to the largest bark beetle (Ips or Dendroctonus spp.) epidemic ever recorded in Arizona. We identified characteristics that predict snag longevity and use by cavity nesters of bark beetle-killed ponderosa pine. We mapped snags and monitored use by wildlife in sites with bark beetle outbreaks in northern Arizona. We measured snag characteristics 3 9 years after outbreaks and used multimodel inference to predict whether a snag was standing or fallen or contained excavated cavities or not. We used spatial statistical tests to determine snag patterns. Although &gt;99% of beetle-killed snags were standing 3 years after outbreaks, &lt;20% remained standing after 7 years. Snags were clumped when initially measured and in subsequent remeasurements. Snags that remained standing had lower surrounding basal area, larger dbh, and more limbs, were more decayed, and were on west-facing lower slopes. Snags with cavities were larger in diameter, had broken tops before falling, and were in open (mean live tree basal area 17 m2/ha) forest.

Black-backed Woodpeckers are known to have variable home-range sizes, yet the ecological factors related to this variation have not been adequately explored and may hold insights into the natural history of the species and the management of its habitat. During 2011 and 2012, we radio-tracked Black-backed Woodpeckers nesting in 3 forested areas of California that burned between 2 and 5 years before the initiation of tracking. Among 15 individuals with robust tracking data, we found that home-range size varied by an order of magnitude, from 24.1 to 304.1 ha, as measured by movement-based kernel estimation. Using an information-theoretic approach, we evaluated the functional relationship between snag basal area-an a priori key resource-and home-range size, additionally controlling for sex, age, and years since fire as covariates. We found that snag basal area alone best predicted home-range size, explaining 54-62% of observed variation. As snag basal area increased, home-range sizes exponentially decreased. This relationship held true both with and without the inclusion of 3 individuals that nested in burned forest yet foraged predominantly outside the fire perimeter in unburned forest. Snag basal area, unlike other potential influences on home-range size, is an attribute that forest managers can directly influence. We describe a quantitative relationship between home-range size and snag basal area that forest managers can use to predict Black-backed Woodpecker pair density in burned forests and assess the likely population consequences of specific harvest treatments. Given that the birds in our study, foraging primarily in burned forest, all had home ranges with an average snag basal area ≥17 m2 ha-1, this may represent a benchmark for minimum habitat needs in postfire stands. © 2014 Cooper Ornithological Society.","Black-backed Woodpecker; Burned forest; Fire; Home range; Overlap; Picoides arcticus; Snag basal area; Space use",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908569401

Thus, the spatial configuration of resources within home ranges should influence bird movements, and resource values should be relative to their locations. We radio-tracked 22 Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) and related their space use and home range sizes to available resources while taking nest site locations into account. We developed utilization distributions (UDs) from nuthatch locations, and treated the area of each 95% isopleth as home range size and the height of the UD as relative probability of use. We fit models relating home range size to mean resource measures within home ranges, and used lognormal regression to relate intensity of use to resource metrics at random points by ranking linear mixed models. Nuthatch home ranges typically had two centers of activity. Areas of high use were associated with the density of recently killed snags (likely a foraging resource), recent prescribed fire, pine dominance, low tree stocking rates, and grassy herbaceous cover. Home ranges were generally large (median: 7.1 ha; range: 0.3-47.6 ha), and smaller home range sizes were associated with pine dominance and higher nest snag density. Predicted home range sizes decreased by 77% and 69%, respectively, when percent pine and nest snag density were maximized. Our results illustrate that movement decisions within home ranges are driven by both the availability and spatial distribution of resources, while ongoing savannah-woodland management is providing resources that are used by Brown-headed Nuthatches. © 2014 American Ornithologists' Union.","Home range size; Optimal foraging theory; Resource selection; Sitta pusilla; Utilization distributions",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908596366

Current efforts to restore longleaf pine to upland sites dominated by second-growth loblolly pine require information about how restoration treatments affect sub-canopy vegetation. We established a field experiment at Fort Benning in Georgia and Alabama, USA to determine the effects of four levels of approximately uniform canopy density (Control [~16m2/ha basal area], MedBA [~9m2/ha basal area], LowBA [~5m2/ha basal area], and Clearcut [0m2/ha basal area]) and three cultural treatments (NT [untreated], H [chemical control of woody and herbaceous vegetation] and H+F [chemical control plus fertilization]) on vegetation structure and functional group composition for three growing seasons following canopy removal. In general, cover (a measure of abundance) of ground layer vegetation increased with the amount of canopy removal. The ground layer was dominated by herbaceous vegetation in each year. Canopy trees generally suppressed the cover of graminoids in the first two years after treatment but only the Control plots had lower graminoid cover than Clearcut plots after the third growing season. Forb cover was significantly lower on Control plots than on Clearcut plots after only the first growing season, and woody stems/shrubs had lower cover on Control plots than on LowBA or Clearcut plots in each year. Vegetation cover increased following the first year after canopy removal, and the relative dominance of functional groups did not change through time. Canopy retention limited the development of mid-story woody stems, with the greatest stem densities in the Clearcut plots. The herbicide treatment (on both H and H+F) significantly reduced woody stem density in the mid-story in 2009, but the effect was no longer significant in 2010. Traditional methods for converting stands of other pine species to longleaf pine commonly include clearcutting followed by planting, but our results suggest that clearcutting may release woody vegetation to increase mid-story stem densities and will reduce the amount of pine needles in the fuel bed. Retaining low to moderate levels of canopy density (5-9m2/ha basal area) in loblolly pine stands may provide an effective balance for reaching multiple restoration objectives that include maintaining desirable vegetation structure and creating fuel conditions for a frequent fire regime. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.","Canopy retention; Ecological restoration; Fertilization; Herbicide; Mid-story density",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898785054

The author examines: the natural history of southern grasslandstheir origin and history (geologic, vegetation, and human)biological hotspots and endangered ecosystemsphysical determinants of grassland distribution, including ecology, soils, landform, and hydrology fire, herbivores, and ecological interactions.The final chapter presents a general conservation strategy for southern grasslands, including prioritization, protection, restoration, and management. Also included are examples of ongoing restoration projects, along with a prognosis for the future. In addition to offering fascinating new information about these little-studied ecosystems, Noss demonstrates how natural history is central to the practice of conservation. Natural history has been on a declining trajectory for decades, as theory and experimentation have dominated the field of ecology. Ecologists are coming to realize that these divergent approaches are in fact complementary, and that pursuing them together can bring greater knowledge and understanding of how the natural world works and how we can best conserve it. ""Forgotten Grasslands of the South"" explores the overarching importance of ecological processes in maintaining healthy ecosystems, and is the first book of its kind to apply natural history, in a modern, comprehensive sense, to the conservation of biodiversity across a broad region. It sets a new standard for scientific literature and is essential reading not only for those who study and work to conserve the grasslands of the South but also for everyone who is fascinated by the natural world. © 2013 Island Press.

However, management practices aimed at reducing the economic impact of natural disturbances can result in habitat loss for this species. Although black-backed woodpeckers occupy habitats created by wildfire, prescribed fire, and mountain pine beetle infestations, the relative value of these habitats remains unknown. We studied habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probabilities and reproductive rates between April 2008 and August 2012 in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We estimated habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probability with Bayesian multi-state models and habitat-specific reproductive success with Bayesian nest survival models. We calculated asymptotic population growth rates from estimated demographic rates with matrix projection models. Adult and juvenile survival and nest success were highest in habitat created by summer wildfire, intermediate in MPB infestations, and lowest in habitat created by fall prescribed fire. Mean posterior distributions of population growth rates indicated growing populations in habitat created by summer wildfire and declining populations in fall prescribed fire and mountain pine beetle infestations. Our finding that population growth rates were positive only in habitat created by summer wildfire underscores the need to maintain early post-wildfire habitat across the landscape. The lower growth rates in fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations may be attributed to differences in predator communities and food resources relative to summer wildfire.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899713938

In the northern Lake States, USA land use change has impacted fire-dependent mixed-pine forests of red pine (Pinus resinosa Ait.) and eastern white pine (P. strobus L.). Although restoration is now being conducted on many federal and state forestlands, we currently lack baseline data on wildlife communities. To address the need for such information we sampled 25 reference and 29 altered mixed-pine sites in a wetland-upland landscape mosaic representative of eastern Upper Michigan. We put forward three questions: (1) do bird communities differ between reference sites and altered sites?; (2) what forest compositional and structural attributes are associated with differences in bird communities and how might they be related to fire history?; and (3) how does heterogeneity of natural land cover affect bird communities? Analyses revealed that richness of forest bird species was greater in reference sites (T= -1.93, P= 0.06), even though reference sites exist within 20-ha patches with less forest and more wetlands compared to altered sites. Bird assemblages also differed between reference and altered sites (Multiple Permutation Procedure, T= -5.26, A= 0.02, P≤. 0.001). Eight indicator species were associated with reference sites, and four species were found in altered sites. Although correlations among environmental variables were generally low, they suggested the important role fire played in this ecosystem. Our findings support the hypothesis that mixed-pine ecosystem restoration can be an important management tool in restoring bird communities. © 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Eastern white pine; Fire; Red pine; Restoration; Wildlife",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893552995

However, most organisms that breed on the Channel Islands remain unstudied with respect to genetic differentiation from mainland populations. By comparing patterns of genetic variation between the Channel Islands and the mainland, we aimed to further our understanding of the role that the Channel Islands have played in diversification of the North American biota. We evaluated long-standing, untested hypotheses regarding colonization patterns and evolutionary relationships among western populations of the Horned Lark (Eremophila alpestris), including the endemic Channel Island subspecies E. a. insularis. We also examined how many times Horned Larks have colonized the Channel Islands, whether the species exhibits asymmetrical patterns of gene flow between mainland and island populations, and whether E. a. strigata of the Pacific Northwest is closely related to the phenotypically similar, but geographically separated, island subspecies. We found that E. a. insularis is polyphyletic, which suggests either multiple colonization events from the mainland or incomplete lineage sorting of a large ancestral population. We also inferred higher rates of migration from the Channel Islands to the mainland, with E. a. strigata being closely related to individuals from the Channel Islands and coastal southern California. Moreover, ecological niche models for E. a. strigata identified suitable abiotic conditions in southern California and the Pacific Northwest during the Last Glacial Maximum, which suggests that E. a. strigata experienced a postglacial range shift in addition to a population bottleneck. Our results provide novel insight regarding the origins of the Channel Island avifauna and the evolutionary history of the Horned Lark in the western United States. Moreover, our findings suggest that Channel Island birds may be weakly differentiated from mainland populations despite phenotypic differences between recognized subspecies. © 2014 American Ornithologists' Union.","Alaudidae; Eremophila alpestris; glacial refugia; mitochondrial DNA; niche modeling; phylogeography",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925301958

Forest edges are an important component of these heterogeneous landscapes but there have been few studies on intermediate-aged forest edges which are needed for a comprehensive perspective on the spatiotemporal dynamics of forest edges. We described the structure, composition and extent of edge influence at 13, 25 and 39-year old fire edges in black spruce boreal forest in northwestern Québec and northeastern Ontario to characterize their structural development and to assess effects of edge development on the understorey. Forest structure and understorey composition were sampled along transects perpendicular to edges of the fires. Edge influence was assessed using randomization tests. Black spruce forest was relatively unaffected by edge influence beyond 5. m into the forest at all ages of edges studied. Edge influence on the understorey was weak and not extensive at intermediate-aged edges with few consistent responses of individual species. Less decayed snags and logs at 13 and 25-year old edges peaked in abundance at or near the edge with values higher than in either adjacent ecosystem. Overall, intermediate-aged fire edges in black spruce forest showed little evidence of further changes in canopy structure with time. Structural development of these edges as well as the regeneration of the disturbed areas also resulted in reduced edge influence on the understorey. A new insight from our study is that intermediate-aged forest edges may contribute unique structural features to landscapes such as a reservoir of deadwood that may be important for wildlife species. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Deadwood; Edge development; Edge influence; Fire edges; Structural development",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84891361817

Previous studies have used only a portion of available fire severity data, or considered only a portion of the Sierra Nevada. Our goal was to investigate whether a trend in fire severity is occurring in Sierra Nevada conifer forests currently, using satellite imagery. We analysed all available fire severity data, 1984-2010, over the whole ecoregion and found no trend in proportion, area or patch size of high-severity fire. The rate of high-severity fire has been lower since 1984 than the estimated historical rate. Responses of fire behaviour to climate change and fire suppression may be more complex than assumed. A better understanding of spatiotemporal patterns in fire regimes is needed to predict future fire regimes and their biological effects. Mechanisms underlying the lack of an expected climate- and time since fire-related trend in high-severity fire need to be identified to help calibrate projections of future fire. The effects of climate change on high-severity fire extent may remain small compared with fire suppression.

Natural fire regimes, which influence habitat quality and sociobiology, have been replaced by controlled fire management in most ecosystems. Managing fire mosaics (vegetation at different ages since fire) can be important to sustain species in fire-maintained habitats, but requirements are usually poorly defined. Source-sink theory provides a foundation to quantify such habitat heterogeneity, but source-sink applications are largely focused on modeling. We quantified how habitat quality, breeder experience and non-breeding adult helpers affected Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) recruitment to describe source-sink heterogeneity within local populations. We used 22 years of census data of uniquely marked Florida scrub-jays to measure recruitment at 36 sites and combined that data with habitat-specific survival to characterize habitat-specific demography. To define habitat quality at the territory scale, we used static habitat features (soils, scrub oak cover) and dynamic habitat states (shrub heights and open sandy patches) that resulted from fire mosaics. Habitat quality most affected recruitment followed by the presence of helpers; fire mosaics, described by habitat states, determined whether territories functioned as strong sources, weak sources or sinks. Subdividing landscapes into habitat states allowed quantification of the fire mosaic at the territory scale and population scale, as the proportions of habitat states can predict local population growth rates. Our approach provides an example of how characterizing habitat quality at the territory scale, relative to source-sink categories, can explain habitat heterogeneity within local populations and inform fire management. © 2013 The Zoological Society of London.","Fire mosaic; GLMM; Habitat quality; Recruitment; Sociobiology; Source-sink",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84892477317

Forest management practices that reduce the amount of disturbed forest may lead to habitat loss for Black-backed Woodpeckers, which have recently been petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act. We studied home range size and resource selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers occupying habitat created by summer wildfire, fall prescribed fire, and MPB infestations in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We studied home range size and resource selection by attaching radio-transmitters to adult Black-backed Woodpeckers. We estimated home range size using fixed kernel density techniques (n=28 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n=19 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n=27 in MPB infestations). We evaluated resource selection with a random-effects discrete choice model in a Bayesian framework (n=5 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n=16 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n=8 in habitat created by MPB infestations). Home range size was smallest in 1-2year post summer wildfire habitat (mean home range size=79ha) and 2-year post fall prescribed fire habitat (mean home range size=143ha). Home range size was intermediate in MPB infestations (mean home range size=307ha) and was greatest in 3-4year post fire habitat (mean summer wildfire home range size=430 hectares, mean fall prescribed fire home range size=460ha). The relative probability that a Black-backed Woodpecker used a tree increased with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal area and was greatest on disturbance-killed trees. These results suggest 1-2year post summer wildfire habitat may have the greatest relative value to Black-backed Woodpeckers and that MPB infestations may be more important as post-fire habitats age. We recommend retaining patches of 1-2year post summer wildfire habitat that are at least 200ha by exempting portions of recently burned forest from salvage logging. This recommendation can be accomplished by exempting salvage logging in summer wildfires &lt;200ha and retaining at least 50% of summer wildfires &gt;400ha.

Many species of animal depend on hollows (cavities) for breeding and shelter, and are impacted by these changes. One such species is the endangered Carnaby's Cockatoo Calyptorhynchus latirostris, an endemic of southwestern Australia, which nests in large hollows in eucalypt trees. Nest hollow selection by a breeding population at Coomallo Creek, in the wheatbelt of Western Australia, was studied from 1969 to 2013. The cockatoos nested in any hollow large enough to access (mean entrance diameter 270 mm, floor diameter 407 mm and depth 1.24. m). Nesting attempts in shallow hollows (<400 mm) were less successful than those in deeper hollows (>1000 mm). Breeding females returned to the same hollow they used previously, provided they had been successful in the previous breeding attempt and the hollow was not occupied. During the study, the cockatoos used 252 large hollow-bearing trees.

Based on this rate of loss, only 29% of large hollow-bearing trees standing in 2013 will be extant in 2125 and not all of these can be expected to offer useable nest hollows.

Eleven of the 14 roosts (79%) were in dead trees. Our results suggest that in burned forests the Black-backed Woodpecker may benefit if, during salvage logging, emphasis is placed on retaining snags with burned-out hollows, forked trunks, or other relatively unusual structures that may create crevices or other opportunities for shelter.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922059056

To investigate these processes, we conducted a replicated, spatiotemporal landscape genetics study of two Australian woodland lizard species [Amphibolurus norrisi (Agamidae) and Ctenotus atlas (Scincidae)]. Agamids have a more complex social and territory structure than skinks, so fire might have a greater impact on their population structure and thus genetic diversity. Genetic diversity increased with time since fire in C. atlas and decreased with time since fire in A. norrisi. For C. atlas, this might reflect its increasing population size after fire, but we could not detect increased gene flow that would reduce the loss of genetic diversity through genetic drift. Using landscape resistance analyses, we found no evidence that postfire habitat succession or topography affected gene flow in either species and we were unable to distinguish between survival and immigration as modes of postfire re-establishment. In A. norrisi, we detected female-biased dispersal, likely reflecting its territorial social structure and polygynous mating system. The increased genetic diversity in A. norrisi in recently burnt habitat might reflect a temporary disruption of its territoriality and increased male dispersal, a hypothesis that was supported with a simulation experiment. Our results suggest that the effects of disturbance on genetic diversity will be stronger for species with territorial social organization. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","biodiversity conservation; dispersal; disturbance; fire regime; landscape genetics; reptile",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84900814149

We aimed to increase our understanding of how patch size, dynamics and connectivity affect colonization-extinction dynamics and the occurrence patterns of a beetle (Stephanopachys linearis), which breeds only in burned trees, existing as dynamic habitat patches that have become rare in managed forest landscapes. We assessed species' presence/absence twice in all known habitat patches (i.e. > 1 ha sites where forest fires had occurred during the previous 2-15 yr) in a 200 × 150 km region of central Sweden, dominated by managed boreal forest. Evaluated over six years, the colonization rate was 47% and the local extinction risk was 65%. Probability of colonization increased with patch size (number of suitable trees in a site) and connectivity to occupied patches within 30 km, and decreased with increasing time since fire. Local extinction risk decreased with habitat patch size but increased, unexpectedly, with connectivity. Occurrence increased with patch size and decreased with increasing time since fire. At a regional scale, S. linearis tracks the fire dynamics by colonising sites with burned trees and by becoming extinct at rates which make the species rare at sites where burnt trees are more than eight years old. In managed boreal forest landscapes, a large proportion of sites may be created by prescribed burning (in our study area: 82%), and consequently human decisions strongly affect the future amount of habitat for fire-dependent species and its spatial distribution. Stephanopachys linearis uses burned sites more often if more trees are retained and, to some extent, if sites are concentrated in those parts of a region that already support high population densities of the species.

Sample plots centered on focal California black oaks (Quercus kelloggii) were established to evaluate oak and neighboring tree and shrub recovery across a gradient of fire severity in the southern Cascade Range, USA. Shrub and oak resprouting was strongest around focal oaks where conifer mortality was greatest. Linear modeling revealed negative relationships between California black oak sprout height or basal area and residual overstory tree survival, primarily white fir (Abies concolor). The two dominant competing species, California black oak and white fir, showed opposite responses to fire severity. Sprouting California black oak and associated shrubs dominated in severely burned areas, while surviving, non-sprouting white fir maintained dominance by its height advantage and shading effects in areas that burned with low fire severity. Our results indicate that high-severity fire promotes persistence and restoration of ecosystems containing resprouting species, such as California black oak, that are increasingly rare due to widespread fire exclusion in landscapes that historically experienced more frequent fire. We present a conceptual model based on our results and supported by a synthesis of postfire resprouting dynamics literature. Our results and conceptual model help illuminate long-term postfire vegetation responses and the potential ability of fire to catalyze formation of alternate vegetation community structures that may not be apparent in studies that evaluate postfire effects at shorter time-since-fire intervals or at coarser scales. © 2014 by the Ecological Society of America.","Alternative vegetation states; Conifer encroachment; Fire effects; Fire exclusion; Quercus kelloggii; Resprouting; Top-kill; Tree mortality",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893382742

It also inhabits green forest but little is known about occurrence and habitat use patterns outside of burned areas, especially in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We used point count and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011 - 2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since 1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects, number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest, and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05 and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in efforts to conserve this rare species. © 2014 by the author(s).

In the Sierra Nevada of California, CESFs are most often produced by mixed-severity fires, which include landscape patches burned at high severity. These forests support diverse plant and wildlife communities rarely found elsewhere in the Sierra Nevada. Severe fires are, therefore, essential to the region's ecological integrity. Ecologically detrimental management of CESFs, or unburned forests that may become CESF's following fire, is degrading the region's globally outstanding qualities. Unlike old-growth forests. CESFs have received little attention in conservation and reserve management. Thus, we describe important ecological attributes of CESFs and distinguish them from early serai conditions created by logging.

Prescribed fires that coincide with the sparrow's nesting season are increasingly used to manage sparrow habitat, but concerns exist regarding the effects that nesting-season fires may pose to this understory-dwelling species. Previous studies suggested that threats posed by fires might be lessened by reducing the extent of prescribed fires, thereby providing unburned areas close to the areas where fires eliminate ground-cover vegetation. To assess this hypothesis, we monitored color-marked male Bachman's Sparrows on 2 sites where the extent of nesting-season fires differed 5-fold (> 70 ha vs. < 15 ha). Monthly survival for males did not differ between the large-and small-extent treatments, and survival rates exceeded 90% for all months except one during the second year of our study when fires were applied later in the season. Male densities also did not differ between treatments, but treatment-by-year interactions pointed to effects relating to the specific time that fires were applied. The distances separating observations of marked males before and after burns were smaller on small-extent treatments in the first year of study but larger on the small-extent treatments in the second year of study. Burn extents also had no consistent effect on postburn reproductive status. The largest extent we examined could have been too small to affect sparrow populations, but responses may also reflect sustainable metapopulation dynamics in a setting where a large sparrow population is maintained at a regional scale (> 100,000 ha) using frequent prescribed fire (≤ 2-yr return intervals). Additional research is needed regarding the effects that nesting-season fires may have on small, isolated populations as well as sites where much larger burn extents (> 100 ha) or longer burn intervals (> 2 yr) are used. © 2014 by the author(s).","Bachman's sparrow; Longleaf pine; Nesting season; Peucaea aestivalis; Pinus palustris; Prescribed fire; Site fidelity; Survival",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903786438

Based on an initial inventory consisting of dry weight and fuel bed depth measurements conducted posttreatment, accumulations in the cut-to-length treatment were elevated according to most measures.

Concerns over high-severity fire and reduced timber harvesting have led to programs to commercially thin forests, and this may occur within habitat designated as ""critical"" for spotted owls. However, thinning is only allowed under the U.S. Government spotted owl guidelines if the long-term benefits clearly outweigh adverse impacts. This possibility remains uncertain. Adverse impacts from commercial thinning may be caused by removal of key habitat elements and creation of forests that are more open than those likely to be occupied by spotted owls. Benefits of thinning may accrue through reduction in high-severity fire, yet whether the firereduction benefits accrue faster than the adverse impacts of reduced late-successional habitat from thinning remains an untested hypothesis. We found that rotations of severe fire (the time required for high-severity fire to burn an area equal to the area of interest once) in spotted owl habitat since 1996, the earliest date we could use, were 362 and 913 years for the two regions of interest: the Klamath and dry Cascades. Using empirical data, we calculated the future amount of spotted owl habitat that may be maintained with these rates of high-severity fire and ongoing forest regrowth rates with and without commercial thinning. Over 40 years, habitat loss would be far greater than with no thinning because, under a ""best case"" scenario, thinning reduced 3.4 and 6.0 times more dense, late-successional forest than it prevented from burning in high-severity fire in the Klamath and dry Cascades, respectively. Even if rates of fire increase substantially, the requirement that the long-term benefits of commercial thinning clearly outweigh adverse impacts is not attainable with commercial thinning in spotted owl habitat. It is also becoming increasingly recognized that exclusion of high-severity fire may not benefit spotted owls in areas where owls evolved with reoccurring fires in the landscape. © Odion et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.","Fire rotation; Forest regrowth rate; Forest thinning; Future habitat; Habitat loss; Late-successional forest; Policy implications; Severe fire; Spotted Owl",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84925507448

Natural disturbances, such as fire, can reduce carbon storage. However, many forests and dependent species evolved with frequent fire as an integral ecosystem process. We used a landscape forest simulation model to evaluate the effects of endangered species habitat management on carbon sequestration. We compared unmanaged forests (control) to forests managed with prescribed burning and prescribed burning combined with thinning. Management treatments followed guidelines of the recovery plan for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW), which requires low-density longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest. The unmanaged treatment provided the greatest carbon storage, but at the cost of lost RCW habitat. Thinning and burning treatments expanded RCW habitat by increasing the dominance of longleaf pine and reducing forest density, but stored 22% less total ecosystem carbon compared to the control. Our results demonstrate that continued carbon sequestration and the provision of RCW habitat are not incompatible goals, although there is a tradeoff between habitat extent and total ecosystem carbon across the landscape. Management for RCW habitat might also increase ecosystem resilience, as longleaf pine is tolerant of fire and drought, and resistant to pests. Restoring fire-adapted forests requires a reduction in carbon. However, the size of the reduction, the effects on sequestration rates, and the co-benefits from other ecosystem services should be evaluated in the context of the specific forest community targeted for restoration. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem services; endangered species; fire; longleaf pine; Pinus palustris; prescribed burning; red-cockaded woodpecker",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84922176275

We examined how time since fire can influence food resources for the endangered Carnaby's cockatoo (Calyptorhynchus latirostris) in banksia woodlands of southwestern Australia. Tree density and cone productivity of dominant plant species, Banksia attenuata and Banksia menziesii, were compared across 44 sites of varying post-fire aged vegetation. The number of Carnaby's cockatoos that could be supported in banksia woodlands was estimated using the bird's energetic requirements and seed energy content. Banksia attenuata produced more cones at sites aged 10-30. years since fire in both survey years, while cone productivity for B. menziesii was highest in very old sites (>35. years since fire) in one year only. Higher numbers of Carnaby's cockatoos were predicted to be supported in vegetation aged between 14-30. years since fire, peaking in vegetation aged 20-25. years. The current distribution of post-fire aged vegetation within this area (>60% burnt within the last 7. years) is predicted to support ~2725 Carnaby's cockatoos, representing 25-35% of the estimated birds reliant on the area. Our results indicate that food resources are influenced by time since fire and, consequently, if optimising food resources was an objective, may be manipulated by altering burning patterns. While human and asset protection is a priority for prescribed burning, management of landscapes for improved persistence of threatened species is also important and complex trade-offs will have to be considered. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Banksia woodland; Bird conservation; Carnaby's cockatoo; Fire; Fire management; Prescribed burn; Resource availability; Threatened species",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899826997

Tree density and percent debris cover (litter and large woody debris) were greater at nest sites in unburned stands because fire kills live trees and consumes woody debris, and they were the only characteristics in which nest sites in burned and unburned forests differed. In burned stands cavities were oriented primarily east, whereas in unburned stands they were oriented randomly. East-facing cavities may be thermally advantageous early in the day, keeping eggs warmer when the incubating female is away foraging. Most snags containing bluebird nest cavities (73%) were advanced in decay and had broken tops. Of the cavities whose original excavator was known, 27% were excavated by the Hairy Woodpecker (Picoides villosus), 12% by the White-headed Woodpecker (P. albolarvatus), and 5% by the Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus). Only one nest was located in a non-excavated cavity. Of the 38 second nests, 76% were in the same cavity as the first, even though 38% of these first attempts were unsuccessful, suggesting that suitable cavities are limiting.

However, fire prescriptions based on average historical fire regimes do not consider natural stochastic variability in fire season and frequency. Applying prescribed fire based on averages could alter the relative abundance of important plant species and structure. We evaluated the density and distribution of oak (Quercus spp.) and persimmon (Diospyros virgiana) stems and mast after 22 yr of a historical-based growing-season fire prescription that failed to consider the variability in historical fire regimes. We randomly established 30 25-m transects in each of 5 vegetation types and counted reproductively mature oak and persimmon stems and their fruits. In upland longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) stands, this fire regime killed young hardwood trees, thereby decreasing compositional and structural heterogeneity within the upland pine vegetation type and limiting occurrence of the upland hardwood vegetation type. Acorns and persimmons were disproportionately distributed near firebreaks within low intensity fire transition zones. Mast was maintained, though in an unnatural distribution, as a result of an elaborate firebreak system. Our data indicate managed fire regimes may fail to mimic spatial distribution, frequency, and intensity of historical disturbances even when the fire prescription is based on empirical reference fire regimes. To maximize structural heterogeneity and conserve key ecosystem functionality, fire prescriptions should include variations in frequency, season, application method, and fire weather conditions rather than focusing on an average historical fire regime. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Such species are frequently targeted for reduction or eradication to further conservation or restoration of biological diversity because the dominant paradigm in restoration of fire-dependent communities is to reduce the dominance or eliminate fire-intolerant invaders. To explore this paradigm, we examined the role of oaks (Quercus spp.) within fire-dependent upland and sandhill longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystems of the southeastern United States. These pine-oak ecosystems have among the highest levels of biodiversity in the temperate zone. This diversity is inextricably linked to a frequent fire regime and includes many species readily top-killed by fire, particularly oaks, which were common in the early settlement landscape. In examining the diversity of oak species found within longleaf pine ecosystems, we identify a group of pyrophytic oaks and show that these oaks are critical components of sandhill and other longleaf pine ecosystems, and their occurrence should be considered as part of conservation and restoration goals. Providing a better understanding of the ecological role of such species will benefit conservation management and strategic planning in fire-prone southeastern ecosystems and more broadly where fire is used as a management tool. © 2014 The Wildlife Society.","biodiversity; ecological integrity; ecological restoration; ecosystem processes; Pinus palustris; prescribed fire; pyrophytes; Quercus",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84898059276

This publicity could potentially generate financial and political support to prevent the species from becoming 'extinct' once again. However, it can also back-fire when publicity creates threats that were previously absent. In 2013, evidence that the Sumatran rhinoceros Dicerorhinus sumatrensis still existed in Kalimantan, the Indonesian part of the island of Borneo, made global headlines. The species was thought to have been extinct there for over a quarter of a century. The threat of poaching for its horn, however, remains as strong as ever. We question the decision to publicise this rediscovery. We argue that in the decades the species was thought to be extirpated, the population in Kalimantan could persist precisely because of the lack of attention. Interviews with hunters suggests that without information on the presence of rhinos, the perceived financial benefits of hunting down widely dispersed rhinos no longer justified the actual costs. The ""publicize-and-protect"" strategy now envisaged following the widely announced rediscovery of rhinos in Kalimantan requires immediate major conservation intervention, which, given the track record of conservation in Indonesia, is unlikely to be effective. We suggest that a secrecy-based strategy for Kalimantan's rhinos would have had lower risks and potentially higher long-term returns for conservation. The trade-offs facing organizations with the exciting prospect of a Lazarus species is one between the costs and benefits of publicity. Costs and benefits change over time but may not do so at the same rate, and publicity can change these rates significantly. When, without publicity, costs are expected to remain relatively constant over time, or when publicity increases the risk significantly relatively to benefits, secrecy-based strategies should be favoured to develop ways that maximize the likelihood of benefits exceeding costs. For Kalimantan's rhinos the choice to publicize-and-protect has been made, closing the door for a strategy based on secrecy, and making effective conservation solutions now all the more urgent. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.","Conservation strategies; Extinction; Indonesia; Media; Sumatran rhinoceros",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899837664

An integrated modelling framework was used to predict the viability of plant populations for five species in southern California's Mediterranean-type ecosystem. The framework integrates forecasts of land-use change from an urban growth model with projections of future climatically-suitable habitat from climate and species distribution models, which are linked to a stochastic population model. The population model incorporates the effects of disturbance regimes and management actions on population viability. This framework: (1) ranks threats by their relative and cumulative impacts on population viability, such as land-use change, climate change, altered disturbance regimes or invasive species, and (2) ranks management responses in terms of their effectiveness for land protection, assisted dispersal, fire management and invasive species control. Too-frequent fire was often the top threat for the species studied, thus fire reduction was ranked the most important management option.

We tested the hypothesis that such variation influences post fire arthropod communities and faunal recovery rates on a 1 m2 scale. We measured the abundance and species richness of selected arthropod taxa pre- and post-fire in patches of leaf litter experimentally burned at different intensities. Arthropod abundance declined sharply immediately after a burn and decreased with increasing fire intensity. Consistent with other studies of this system, the effects of fire on arthropod communities were still apparent &gt;4 w post burn. The abundance of epigeic beetles recovered more quickly than the abundance of ants or springtails in some treatments. Recovery rates also differed among treatments but did not consistently support the prediction that recovery would be faster in plots subject to low intensity burns. We conclude that small scale differences in intensity within prescribed fires have measurable effects on litter arthropod communities in Ozark forests; however, these differences appear to be overshadowed by the more general effects of fire on arthropods. © 2014, American Midland Naturalist.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903714457

Restoration of mixed-oak (Quercus spp.) forest is also a concern because of widespread oak regeneration failure, especially on moist, productive sites where competition from faster-growing tree species is fierce following stand-replacing disturbances. Several silvicultural methods are proposed to promote oak regeneration but many are not experimentally tested, especially on productive sites. We surveyed birds in 19 stands to assess response to initial application of three proposed oak regeneration treatments on productive sites: prescribed burning (B); oak shelterwood by midstory herbicide (OSW); shelterwood harvests (SW); and controls (C), for one breeding season before, and two breeding seasons after, implementation. Relative density of successional-scrub species Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), Eastern Towhees (Pipilo erythrophthalmus), and Chestnut-sided Warblers (Setophaga pensylvanica) increased, while Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) decreased within 11 to 18 months after SW harvests; understory disturbance treatments B or OSW had no effect. Our results indicated that partial harvests created habitat for breeding birds associated with both young and mature forests, whereas understory treatments had little effect. Additionally, we show that even small patches of young forest habitat are used by more individuals and more species of breeding birds than surrounding closed-canopy forest, and may benefit successional-scrub species by enabling their occurrence in an otherwise forested landscape. Absence of several lower-elevation successional-scrub bird species in our mid-elevation SW harvests suggests that comprehensive conservation in the southern Appalachians necessitates creating and maintaining young forest habitats across elevation gradients.","bird community; breeding birds; early successional habitat; oak regeneration; prescribed fire; silviculture",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908599591

Fire suppression, in particular, has facilitated encroachment by non-fire-tolerant trees and heavy litter buildup, leading to shifts in the native plant and animal community. In 2001, efforts were initiated to re-establish parts of Berry College's (Floyd County, GA) fire-suppressed mountain longleaf pine forest using combinations of prescribed fire, clear-cutting, planting, and herbicide application. We designed this study to determine the effects of management practices thus far on vegetation structure and the bird community. In 2009, vegetation structure data were collected in longleaf pine stands comprising three management classes ranging from low- to high-intensity management. Bird surveys were conducted from summer 2009 to spring 2010, and avifaunal community structure was related to vegetative characteristics within each stand. Unmanaged stands were strongly associated with common omnivorous, ground-foraging, and canopy-nesting birds of mixed woodlands. Intermediately managed stands contained mostly birds of mixed diet and aerial- and bark-feeding cavity nesters. Heavily managed stands were strongly associated with insect-, vertebrate-, seed-, and fruit-eating ground and shrub nesters, with several sightings of the near-threatened Bachman's sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis Lichtenstein). Intensity of management was positively correlated with canopy openness, understory development, and low litter levels. These vegetative differences helped explain the bird community makeup. We provide baseline data for assessing the impacts of management of mountain longleaf pine and similarly fire-suppressed forests on avian abundance and species richness.","bird community; management; Pinus palustris; prescribed fire; Southeast U.S.; vegetative cover",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893292412

Training activities observably degrade land condition while also increasing biodiversity and stabilizing ecosystems. Moreover, other anthropogenic activities regularly occur on military lands such as prescribed burns and agricultural haying-adding to the dynamics of land condition. Thus, spatially and temporally assessing the impacts of military training, prescribed burning, agricultural haying, and their interactions is critical to the management of military lands. In this study, the spatial distributions and patterns of military training-induced disturbance frequency were derived using plot observation and point observation-based method, at Fort Riley, Kansas from 1989 to 2001. Moreover, spatial and variance analysis of cumulative impacts due to military training, burning, haying, and their interactions on the land condition of Fort Riley were conducted. The results showed that: (1) low disturbance intensity dominated the majority of the study area with exception of concentrated training within centralized areas; (2) high and low values of disturbance frequency were spatially clustered and had spatial patterns that differed significantly from a random distribution; and (3) interactions between prescribed burning and agricultural haying were not significant in terms of either soil erosion or disturbance intensity although their means and variances differed significantly between the burned and non-burned areas and between the hayed and non-hayed areas. © 2014 Springer Science+Business Media.","Cumulative impacts; Installation; Land condition; Military training; Other human activities; Remote sensing; Spatial and temporal assessment",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84902540216

There is now considerably less severe fire than there was historically in the forests of California's Sierra Nevada, owing to fire suppression. Moreover, under current policies for management of public and private forest, much of the snag forest created by fire is subjected to post-fire logging of snags. Mechanical mastication and herbicide spraying of shrubs, followed by planting of conifers, are also common, and large-scale programs of mechanical thinning seek to prevent creation of this habitat. Thus there is reason for concern for birds associated with snag forest. I synthesized existing research to identify the species positively associated with this habitat and assessed their population trends according to the Breeding Bird Survey. In the Sierra Nevada 24 species are associated with snag forest, and half of these are declining or are too rare for the Breeding Bird Survey to detect any trend. For snag-forest species, there are significantly more declines than increases (all snag-forest species with statistically significant population trends are declining), whereas species of unburned forest manifest no such pattern. These results indicate a need for more managed wildland fire, and for current management policies, both pre- and post-fire, to be revisited, particularly in national forests where most of the post-fire habitat exists.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908463891

The continental population of red-crowned cranes continued to decline and the quality of its breeding and wintering habitat also faced serious threats. Shuangtaihekou National Nature Reserve is an important distribution area of western continental population of red-crowned cranes, meanwhile is the main stopover habitat, northern most wintering area and southern most breeding place in China. In recent years, the human disturbance such as tourism, agriculture reclamation, pesticides and oilfield development in Shuangtaihekou Nature Reserve is increasing. The spring migration period is an important life stage for cranes and directly affects the success of next breeding and population dynamic, so the feeding habitat in this period is especially important. The feeding habitat selection of red-crowned crane during spring migration between March and April 2008-2010 was investigated by fixed-point sampling, two-dimensional coordinate method, environment factor measurements, and factor analysis. The results showed that (1) during spring migration, the feeding habitat selection of red-crowned cranes included two scales and three selection levels, respectively are feeding habitat type selection at the macro-habitat scale, feeding ground selection, and feeding micro-habitat selection at the micro-habitat scale; (2) red-crowned cranes preferred to select the feeding habitat type with reed marsh (90.00%), occasionally select corn field, mud bank, and meadow; (3) the feeding ground was selected according to macro-habitat factors and disturbance factors, among them the macro-habitat factors included lakes, dams and burned areas, less than 30 m; disturbance factors included strong avoiding factors, such as residential areas and oil fields, and weak avoiding factors, such as roads, with avoidance of areas greater than 1 km from residential areas, 2 km from oil fields and 300-500 m from roads; and (4) the feeding micro-habitat factors included vegetation height, vegetation density, and vegetation diameter, sites with little vegetation coverage (5%) and vegetation lower than beak length of red-crowned crane were preferred.","Factor analysis; Feeding habitat selection; Red-crowned crane; Scale; Shuangtaihekou nature reserve; Spring migration period",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887272027

Habitat suitability models can predict which sites at new disturbances will most likely attract specialists. Without validation data from newly disturbed areas, however, the best approach for maximizing predictive accuracy can be unclear (Northwestern U.S.A.). We predicted habitat suitability for nesting Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus; a burned-forest specialist) at 20 recently (≤6 years postwildfire) burned locations in Montana using models calibrated with data from three locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. We developed 8 models using three techniques (weighted logistic regression, Maxent, and Mahalanobis D2 models) and various combinations of four environmental variables describing burn severity, the north-south orientation of topographic slope, and prefire canopy cover. After translating model predictions into binary classifications (0 = low suitability to unsuitable, 1 = high to moderate suitability), we compiled ""ensemble predictions,"" consisting of the number of models (0-8) predicting any given site as highly suitable. The suitability status for 40% of the area burned by eastside Montana wildfires was consistent across models and therefore robust to uncertainty in the relative accuracy of particular models and in alternative ecological hypotheses they described. Ensemble predictions exhibited two desirable properties: (1) a positive relationship with apparent rates of nest occurrence at calibration locations and (2) declining model agreement outside surveyed environments consistent with our reduced confidence in novel (i.e., ""no-analogue"") environments. Areas of disagreement among models suggested where future surveys could help validate and refine models for an improved understanding of Black-backed Woodpecker nesting habitat relationships. Ensemble predictions presented here can help guide managers attempting to balance salvage logging with habitat conservation in burned-forest landscapes where black-backed woodpecker nest location data are not immediately available. Ensemble modeling represents a promising tool for guiding conservation of large-scale disturbance specialists. © 2013 The Authors.

The associated loss of biological legacies, such as dead or dying trees, has exposed numerous saproxylic species to high risks of extinction. In contrast, extensive wilderness forests in Northern Mongolia have been sustained owing to significant cultural differences. Here we used saproxylic beetle abundance data gathered during two sampling campaigns in the Mongolian taiga to address whether (1) the saproxylic beetle fauna of the Mongolian taiga is comparable to that of European boreal forests, (2) fires are a natural disturbance regime, indicated by the occurrence of many pyrophilous species, and (3) species rare in Europe are also rare in the Northern Mongolian wilderness. Of 191 saproxylic beetle species identified, 150 (79 %) were also found in Europe. The high number of pyrophilous beetle species (20) indicated that natural species communities are well adapted to this disturbance regime. The species rarity in Germany was significantly positively correlated with the species rarity in Finland, but the species rarity in these two countries was negatively correlated with that in the Mongolian wilderness. Our results indicated that wilderness areas with natural disturbances provide biological legacies important for rare species. Therefore, exploitation of the unique, remaining natural landscapes of the Palaearctic wilderness areas should be stopped. Moreover, we urge conservationists to expand controlled burning for restoration at relict sites of rare boreal species also outside Fennoscandia. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Conservation; Dead wood; Pyrophilous beetles; Salvage logging; Saproxylic beetles; Wilderness",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84884530857

This study investigated the anti-predator response in males of a monogamous species, the red-legged partridge (Alectoris rufa), in relation to the audience. Aerial alarm calls and nonvocal behaviour were analyzed, in order to assess whether they were affected by the presence of an audience, and in particular by the audience's composition: unfamiliar males, unfamiliar females and signallers mates. Rate and spectrographic characteristics of the alarm calls, as well as behavioural responses to a dummy avian raptor, were analyzed in a sample of 18 farm-reared males. Our findings show that the presence of conspecifics was able to alter the number and structure of male alarm calls. In addition, the number of alarm calls drastically decreased when no audience was present: when the male was alone, it might even not vocalize, thus reducing predation risk. The audience composition was also important; the presence of the signaller's mate elicited more calls than that of an unfamiliar male. The spectrographic structure of alarm calls was affected by the audience, mainly in terms of peak frequency.

More recently, it has been demonstrated that raptors are also exposed to the risk of plumbism when feeding on unretrieved quarry that was wounded or killed by hunters. Further studies reveal that even humans can be subject to a significant Pb dose while consuming game animals killed by traditional ammunition. Given the relevance of this issue, several pieces of research have been carried out to assess frequency, dimension, and the number of Pb fragments embedded in the carcasses of ungulates, partridges, ducks, and other birds to evaluate the risk related to the consumption of game meat. In spite of their great importance as quarry species across southern Europe, until now, no data have been available on small passerines. To assess the quantity and type of Pb embedded in songbirds, we x-rayed 196 starlings shot in Italy and found Pb pellets and/or visible fragments in 118 carcasses (60.2 %). We counted 128 shotgun pellets in 85 carcasses. In 28 birds, we detected both whole pellets and lead fragments; in 33, we found only small fragments. By excising and weighing a sample of 20 shotgun pellets (diameter 1.35-1.99 mm), we calculated a Pb load of 3.75 g in the whole sample of 196 starlings, corresponding to an average of 27.32 mg/100 g of body weight. This is a conservative estimation, because fragments were not considered.

Human, since time immemorial, have influenced the landscape they live in a variety of ways resulting in varied land use changes. Increase in population leads to the expansion in agriculture land, built-up areas, uncontrolled forest fires, mining of minerals, extraction of timber and permanent plantations, which in turn are responsible for habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity. Garo hills districts of Meghalaya are endowed with rich biodiversity both in terms of flora and fauna. With the increasing of population there is pressure exerted on these natural resources for the livelihood as there is hardly any alternative available. In the meantime small forest based urban centers were developed and with the expansion of these the requirement of the local people also changed. Due to urbanization and population pressure the traditional shifting cultivation (jhum), which is still the only livelihood of many areas of the Garo hills; have been converted into permanent cash crop areas. This conversion has a reverse impact on the environment. In the traditional jhumming method the native forests which were slushed and burned for agriculture purposes could revive in 18 to 20 years' time (Jhum cycle). But due to the introduction of economically sound plantation crops like areca nut, cashew nut and tea the native diversity of the forest area is in the verse of extinction. The present study reveals that rapid population growth is the solely responsible factor for changes the landscape of Garo hills of Meghalaya.","Cash crop; Garo hills; Jhum; Population pressure; Roads diversion; Urbanization",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880965141

There is ample evidence of the interactions among these factors at small spatial and temporal scales, but projecting their long-term and landscape-scale impacts remains a challenge. We developed a spatially explicit model of European spruce bark beetle (Ips typographus) dynamics that incorporates beetle phenology and forest susceptibility and integrated it in a climate-sensitive landscape model (LandClim). We first corroborated model outputs at various spatial and temporal scales and then applied the model in three case studies (in the Black Forest, Germany, and Davos, Switzerland) that cover an extended climatic gradient. We used this model and case study framework to examine the mechanisms and feedbacks that are driving short-term and long-term interactions among beetle disturbance, climate change, and windthrow, and how they may shift in the future. At the current cold-wet end of the Norway spruce (Picea abies) distribution, climate change is projected to increase temperature and drought, such that beetles become a more dominant disturbance agent. At the warm-dry end of the spruce distribution, where, under current climate, beetle outbreaks are confined to the simultaneous occurrence of drought and windthrow, the simulated level of drought alone sufficed for triggering beetle outbreaks, such that elevated drought- and beetle-induced spruce mortality would negatively feed back on beetle disturbance in the long term. This would lead to receding beetle populations due to the local extinction of Norway spruce. These results suggest that, depending on initial environmental conditions, climate change may shift the importance of direct and indirect drivers of disturbances. These shifts may affect the sign and strength of cross-scale disturbance interactions and may impact the cost-benefit trade-off between beetle suppression and preventive management strategies. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.","Bark beetles; Central Europe; Climate change; Disturbance interaction; European spruce bark beetle; Forest dynamics; Ips typographus; LandClim; Landscape model; Management strategy; Regime shift",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84882250866

Discerning between them has ramifications for the utility of bark as a byproduct of timber harvesting and its functionality on a living tree. Inner bark and outer bark thicknesses for longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) were investigated using disks collected from trees harvested on a 70-year-old plantation. Inner bark thickness was relatively constant up the bole of each tree whereas outer bark thickness rapidly declined from its thickest point at stump height; at relative heights above 20%, the decrease in outer bark thickness was more gradual. The proportion of inner bark, therefore, increased up the bole, from an average of 15% at stump height to above 40% toward the top of the tree. Since inner bark is a richer source of extractives than old outer bark, tree tops may be preferable in terms of bark abundance and quality as feedstock for extractive-based products. Reductions in the inner and outer bark thicknesses on disk drying, with averages of roughly 20 and 10%, respectively, differed when the data were pooled by cardinal direction. Thus, variability in bark thickness around the circumference of a standing tree may actually be a manifestation of differences in bark moisture content.","Biomass utilization; Fire resistance; Phloem; Pinus palustris; Rhytidome",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84883402839

There are six subspecies distributed throughout the African subtropics, all of which manage to breed successfully during the winter dry season when few other cavity-nesting birds are actively nesting. In 2004, we recorded Meyer's Parrots feeding on four cryptic arthropod larvae incubating inside fruits and pods in their seasonal diet. All of these were previously unknown in the diet of African parrots. Nesting females and chicks were fed regurgitate almost exclusively comprising these arthropod larvae for the first 10 weeks after nest occupation. In 2007, we demonstrated that Meyer's Parrots actively search for these protein-rich arthropod larvae and synchronized their breeding effort within our study area to coincide their hatching period with the period of highest relative abundance of these larvae, resulting in a breeding synchrony index value of 79.3 % between females in the population. In 2009, we recorded the consumption of similar arthropod larvae parasitizing similar tree species in northern Zambia and two locations in Tanzania, thus confirming this behaviour throughout their distributional range. Similar behaviour is expected in their closest congeners, the Brown-headed Parrot P. cryptoxanthus and Rüppell's Parrot P. rueppellii. Poor land management practices (e.g. deforestation and frequent fires) most likely influence the abundance of these cryptic arthropod larvae and thus the breeding success of Meyer's Parrot at population level. © 2013 Dt.

Previous research has shown that this scenario leads to genetic homogenization across large spatial scales. However, little is known about fine-scale genetic structuring or how this changes over time in ephemeral patches. We predicted that species that specialize on ephemeral habitats will delay dispersal to exploit natal habitat patches while resources are plentiful and thus display fine-scale structure. To investigate this idea, we evaluated the effect of frequent colonization of ephemeral habitats on the fine-scale genetic structure of a fire specialist, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) and found a pattern of fine-scale genetic structure. We then tested for differences in spatial structure between sexes and detected a pattern consistent with male-biased dispersal. We also detected a temporal increase in relatedness among individuals within newly burned forest patches. Our results indicate that specialist species that outlive their ephemeral patches can accrue significant fine-scale spatial structure that does not necessarily affect spatial structure at larger scales. This highlights the importance of both spatial and temporal scale considerations in both sampling and data interpretation of molecular genetic results. © 2013 Pierson et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879346781

We documented the habitat use and foraging strategies of Celeus obrieni, Kaempfer's Woodpecker, in forested cerrado (savanna) with patches of the bamboo Guadua paniculata near Pium, Tocantins, Brazil. We surveyed for C. obrieni, measured vegetation structure at 30 sites where it was detected and 23 where it was not detected, then compared vegetation characteristics through nonmetric multidimentional scaling and one-way analysis of similarity to determine whether C. obrieni was specializing on particular habitat characteristics. We studied the species' foraging and compared the abundance of prey in drilled and nondrilled stems to evaluate its dietary specialization. All sites with C. obrieni had large, tall stands of G. paniculata, indicating habitat specialization. Drilling most frequently on large, dry stems from 2 to 4 m off the ground, the woodpeckers consumed ants, mainly Camponotus depressus and Azteca fasciata, which colonize the internodes of bamboo stems. Habitat specialists are more vulnerable to habitat loss or alteration but can serve as indicator species for the reaching of conservation goals. Large stands of forested cerrado with patches of bamboo should be conserved for C. obrieni to be maintained.

In grasslands, burning may have this effect for mammalian herbivores by decreasing vegetation height, potentially making burned areas safer habitats. However, few studies have tested the impacts of burning on the perceived predation risk of herbivores. Vigilance can be used as a measure of habitat safety and therefore should be lower in burned areas than unburned areas. We tested the impacts of prescribed burning on vigilance by Thomson's gazelles in Serengeti National Park, Tanzania. Both individual vigilance, proportion of time an individual spends looking, and group vigilance, proportion of a group looking, of Thomson's gazelles was observed in burned and unburned areas before and after presenting a model cheetah to each group. Surprisingly, both individual and group vigilance was the same in both habitats pre- and post-cheetah addition and removal. This is despite the fact that both vegetation height and biomass were lower in burned areas than unburned areas. Thus, it does not appear that Thomson's gazelles perceive burned areas to be safer habitats than unburned areas. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Fire; Habitat choice; Predation; Savannah ecosystem; Top-down control; Trait-mediated interactions",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876436919

In Europe, Dupont's Lark Chersophilus duponti is a threatened open-habitat bird. Prescribed burning has sometimes been proposed for its conservation, but without evidence of its effectiveness. To evaluate the short-term effects of a summer wildfire on this species, we performed several transect counts in the burnt and unburnt parts of a shrubsteppe in central Spain. The same transects were counted within a three-year interval prior to the fire and were repeated during the first two springs after the fire. We also measured the vegetation during the first two springs after the fire. In the burnt area, we observed a decrease of about 85-100% in Dupont's Lark abundance, and about 7-15% in the control area. The disappearance of the scrub cover after fire and its slow regeneration, as well as the large increase in grass cover during the second year, may explain the decrease in this habitat-specialist bird species. Fire should be avoided in areas occupied by the Dupont's Lark, as its negative effects in the short-term may cause local extinctions. However, prescribed burning may be used in neighboring areas to create new open habitats that may be subsequently colonized by this species.","conservation tool; disturbance; fire; Genista pumila; Mediterranean; páramo; shrub-steppe habitat",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84896834253

Many avian species benefit from the use of prescribed fire in pine woodlands; however, the effect fire has on nesting site characteristics is not well understood for many disturbance-dependent species. We located nests of Bachman's Sparrows (Peucaea aestivalis) in mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests managed using frequent prescribed fires (return intervals ≤2 years). Vegetation characteristics were measured at each nest (n = 37), within a 0.04-ha area immediately adjacent to nests, and at different time intervals following burns within a larger 20-ha area surrounding nests. We examined vegetation characteristics within the 20-ha area 2, 6, 12, and 18 months after prescribed burns to compare post-fire plant succession with site characteristics associated with nest sites. Nest sites had lower amounts of grass standing crop, grass ground cover, and higher amounts of woody vegetation than found in the 0.04-ha area immediately surrounding nests. Vegetation structure at nests sites was similar to the structure measured across the 20-ha area <6 months following burns, but vegetation structure at ground level began to deviate ≥6 months after fires such that ≥50% of the values differed from the values recorded at nest sites. Results point to the importance of open vegetation structure at ground level and the need for frequent burning to maintain appropriate nesting habitat. Vegetation characteristics associated with nest sites appear to be highly ephemeral and tightly linked to conditions at ground level. As such, suitable nest sites likely represent a subset of areas occupied by singing males. © 2013 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.","Bachman's Sparrow; Longleaf pine; Nest site; Peucaea aestivalis; Prescribed fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879330100

Understanding responses of wildlife species to fire is essential to native species conservation because contemporary fires may not have the same effects as historical fires. Recent fires in the Chiricahua Mountains of Arizona provided an opportunity to investigate effects of fire heterogeneity on habitat selection of a native wildlife species. We used radiotelemetry to determine home ranges of Mexican fox squirrels (Sciurus nayaritensis chiricahuae) within fire-influenced forests. We then applied resource-utilisation functions to evaluate associations of use intensity within home ranges to heterogeneity of burn severity at two spatial scales. Squirrels used areas with moderate levels of burn heterogeneity at large scale more than areas of low or high heterogeneity. Squirrels used small (<0.5ha) or narrow (<120m) severely burnt patches, but incorporated only edges of large patches into home ranges. Use of burnt forests by Mexican fox squirrels demonstrates the complexities of fire's effects on wildlife.

Recent abandonment of dehesa management has resulted in shrub encroachment, habitat homogenisation and increased fire risk. Mechanical shrub cutting to decrease biomass load creates novel cleared dehesas with yet unknown consequences for the ecosystem function. We investigated the effects of these land use changes on ground dwelling beetles (carabids and staphylinids) as model organisms by comparing traditionally grazed, long-time abandoned and newly cleared dehesas. Land use changes affected beetle species composition by altering habitat structure (e.g., litter layer) and the availability of feeding resources. Grazed dehesas held the highest number of exclusive species and particular functional guilds of carabid seed eaters and staphylinid coprophiles, utilizing food resources related to the presence of grazing livestock (annual herbs and coprophagous insects). Beetle assemblages of abandoned dehesas, resembling those known from surrounding human disturbed oak forests, exhibited the lowest abundance and greatly differed from beetle assemblages of grazed dehesas. Shrub clearance after dehesa abandonment benefited opportunistic beetle predators feeding on decomposers associated with cutting slash left on the ground. The habitat structure and beetle species composition of cleared dehesas slightly approached those of grazed dehesas, therefore suggesting shrub cutting as a first step towards restoration of abandoned dehesas. However, since livestock grazing is an essential driver of ground dwelling beetle composition, it should be promoted after shrub cutting in cleared dehesas to restore the characteristic assemblages, species interactions and ecosystem function of grazed dehesas. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.","Carabid and staphylinid assemblages; Functional guild of species; Land use abandonment; Oak savannah-like forest; Shrub encroachment; Traditional silvopastoral management",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876398673

Existing studies are based on modest sample sizes because of the rarity of this endangered species and the difficulty of radio-tracking bats. Our objectives were to determine resource selection by foraging Indiana bats during the maternity season and to compare resource use between pregnant and lactating individuals. We used an information theoretic approach with discrete choice modeling based on telemetry data to evaluate our hypotheses that land cover, percent canopy cover, distance to water, and prescribed fire affected the relative probability a point was used by a foraging Indiana bat. We fit models for individual bats and a population-level model based on all individuals with a random factor to account for differences in sample size among individuals. We radio-tracked 29 individuals and found variation in resource selection among individuals. However, among individuals with the same supported covariates, the magnitude and direction of the covariates were similar. Eighteen bats selected areas with greater canopy closure and 5 of 6 bats that had areas burned by low-intensity prescribed fire in their home range selected burned areas. Resource selection was related to land cover for 13 individuals; they selected forest and shrubland over agricultural land, which composed >50% of the landscape within 10 km. We found no support for our hypothesis that resource selection was related to individual reproductive condition or Julian date in our population-level model indicating habitat selection was not determined by reproductive status or date within the maternity season. Land use or forest management that greatly reduces canopy cover may have a negative impact on Indiana bat use. Maintaining forest cover in agricultural landscapes is likely critical to persistence of maternity colonies in these landscapes. Sites managed with low severity prescribed fire may be selected by some individuals because of reduced understory vegetation. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","discrete choice; foraging; Indiana bat; Missouri; Myotis sodalis; resource selection",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876402013

Life-history traits associated with each group suggest that they may respond differentially to habitat fragmentation caused by salvage logging, with pyrophilous species having a much higher dispersal potential. In a 2-year-old burn highly fragmented by pre- and post-fire logging, we sampled saproxylic beetles in coniferous and broadleaf burned residual stands along a gradient of spatial context including intensity of fragmentation and isolation from source habitat using Lindgren multiple-funnels traps. Beetle assemblages differed in composition between coniferous and broadleaf burned stands, with secondary users dominating the latter. Pyrophilous species increased in abundance with distance from the edge and avoided unburned patches within the fire. Secondary users did not respond negatively to fragmentation or isolation of burned habitats, with one exception, the alleculid Isomira quadristriata (Couper), being overall diverse and abundant throughout the study area regardless of salvage logging prevalence. No deleterious effects of isolation were thus detected in the occurrence patterns of secondary users, even up to 8 km from the edge. Our results suggest that older burns, especially those having some broadleaf cover, are intensively used by non-pyrophilous saproxylic species usually associated with dead wood in green forests and may contribute to maintain broader saproxylic assemblages than originally thought, especially when considering the importance of dead wood volume pulses associated with fire in boreal forests. © 2012 The Royal Entomological Society.","Dispersal; Forest fire; Habitat loss; Isolation; Pyrophilous insects; Residual habitat; Salvage logging; Saproxylic insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878199968

For populations occupying such environments, fire-induced landscape change is likely to influence population processes, and genetic patterns and structure among populations. The Mallee Emu-wren Stipiturus mallee is an endangered passerine whose global distribution is confined to fire-prone, semi-arid mallee shrublands in south-eastern Australia. This species, with poor capacity for dispersal, has undergone a precipitous reduction in distribution and numbers in recent decades. We used genetic analyses of 11 length-variable, nuclear loci to examine population structure and processes within this species, across its global range. Populations of the Mallee Emu-wren exhibited a low to moderate level of genetic diversity, and evidence of bottlenecks and genetic drift. Bayesian clustering methods revealed weak genetic population structure across the species' range. The direct effects of large fires, together with associated changes in the spatial and temporal patterns of suitable habitat, have the potential to cause population bottlenecks, serial local extinctions and subsequent recolonisation, all of which may interact to erode and homogenise genetic diversity in this species. Movement among temporally and spatially shifting habitat, appears to maintain long-term genetic connectivity. A plausible explanation for the observed genetic patterns is that, following extensive fires, recolonisation exceeds in-situ survival as the primary driver of population recovery in this species. These findings suggest that dynamic, fire-dominated landscapes can drive genetic homogenisation of populations of species with low-mobility and specialised habitat that otherwise would be expected to show strongly structured populations. Such effects must be considered when formulating management actions to conserve species in fire-prone systems. © 2013 Brown et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876576631

The reticulated fatwoods salamander (Am-bystoma bishopi), a federally endangered species, and other rare and declining amphibians, are less likely to breed in low-quality wetlands with high canopy cover and low herbaceous groundcover that typically occur from fire exclusion. Fire rarely carries through these wetlands during winter because of the presence of standing water at this time of year. Our objective was to evaluate whether mechanical removal of the woody midstory could serve as a surrogate for fire, and create high-quality wetlands with moderate canopy cover and high herbaceous groundcover. We chose a series of high-quality (n = 4) and low-quality (n = 21) ephemeral wetlands for study. A subset of the low-quality wetlands were then treated mechanically and with herbicide (n = 8), burned (n = 4), or retained in a low-quality state (n = 7). Mechanical treatments reduced canopy cover (from 55.7% to 41.4%) to similar levels as high-quality sites (36.7%); however, herbaceous groundcover did not increase (17.2% post-treatment compared to 37.3% at high-quality sites). Fire reduced the canopy cover (from 41.3% to 33.0%), and herbaceous ground-cover was similar (33.2% post treatment) to high-quality sites as of four months post burn. More time will be required to assess the response of herbaceous groundcover and whether mechanical methods can be used as a surrogate for fire to restore amphibian breeding habitat. Identifying surrogates for fire could add an important technique to our management toolbox.","Ambystoma bishopi; Amphibians; Fire; Florida; Reticulated fatwoods salamander; Wetlands",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876189491

In territorial species, the spatial dynamics of populations is to a large degree shaped by individuals' ranging behaviour during their juvenile dispersal. Here we use information on juvenile golden eagles (Aquila chrysaetos) tracked by satellite telemetry, to explore the effects of daily behavioural decisions on their dispersal strategy during their first year of life. When analysed on a biweekly basis, the large-scale movements of golden eagles did not differ from a correlated random walk (CRW) model of dispersal. Although in the long term such a strategy maximises the acquisition of information on good hunting areas, finding a mate and a vacant territory in a landscape, it is expensive in terms of energy requirements. At the finer scale of daily foraging movements, movement patterns were non-random, probably reflecting animals' oriented movements towards sites with high chances of successful hunting. We suggest that the key issue to take into account when exploring the factors determining individuals' dispersal strategies is how strongly the daily movements are influenced by an active search for food. This is to a large degree determined by food availability and individuals' ability to accumulate reserves. In our case, the individuals with the lowest proportion of foraging habitats within their dispersal areas showed large-scale movements more restricted than expected from a CRW. Also, distances covered by individuals in their biweekly movements were both larger and more variable in winter, when food availability diminishes. © 2013 Dipartimento di Biologia, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Italia.","Aquila chrysaetos; correlated random walk; dispersal ecology; ranging behaviour; raptors; satellite telemetry; spatial ecology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84876493355

Evaluations of ecological responses to cumulative effects of management interventions and natural disturbances provide critical decision-support tools for managers who strive to balance environmental conservation and economic development. We conducted an experiment to evaluate the effects of salvage logging on avian community composition in lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests affected by beetle outbreaks in Oregon, USA, 1996-1998. Treatments consisted of the removal of lodgepole pine snags only, and live trees were not harvested. We used a Bayesian hierarchical model to quantify occupancy dynamics for 27 breeding species, while accounting for variation in the detection process. We examined how magnitude and precision of treatment effects varied when incorporating prior information from a separate intervention study that occurred in a similar ecological system. Regardless of which prior we evaluated, we found no evidence that the harvest treatment had a negative impact on species richness, with an estimated average of 0.2-2.2 more species in harvested stands than unharvested stands. Estimated average similarity between control and treatment stands ranged from 0.82-0.87 (1 indicating complete similarity between a pair of stands) and suggested that treatment stands did not contain novel assemblies of species responding to the harvesting prescription. Estimated treatment effects were positive for twenty-four (90%) of the species, although the credible intervals contained 0 in all cases. These results suggest that, unlike most post-fire salvage logging prescriptions, selective harvesting after beetle outbreaks may meet multiple management objectives, including the maintenance of avian community richness comparable to what is found in unharvested stands. Our results provide managers with prescription alternatives to respond to severe beetle outbreaks that continue to occur across extensive portions of the dry forests of western North America. © 2013 Giovanini et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875291122

Upland areas of north-central Mississippi that have been protected from fire are now closed-canopy forests including species known to be uncommon as bearing/witness trees in upland portions of the landscape (historically off-site species) and sparse ground cover vegetation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that warm-season grasses were prevalent in the understory of these communities, which could have provided more consistent fuel. We corroborate the historic presence of these grasses by looking at their natural co-occurrence with oak regeneration (a requisite of self-replacing stands of oaks found historically). Restoration of these communities has typically focused on burning and off-site tree thinning. Utilizing a restoration experiment implementing these treatments, we found significantly reduced understory leaf litter in treatment areas. To test which variables associated with restoration treatments were most important for the survival of these grasses, we measured the effect of leaf litter removal and its interaction with environmental conditions on the survival of transplanted shoots. Survival of little bluestem increased with decreasing canopy density and decreasing leaf litter. Leaf-litter removal did not increase survival, nor did it interact with either pre-treatment leaf litter depth or canopy density. These results show that little bluestem benefits from conditions expected historically: increased light and possibly fire. © 2012 Society for Ecological Restoration.","Andropogon virginicus; Fire; Leaf litter; Schizachyrium scoparium; Thinning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874778136

We quantified the short-term responses of leaf litter ants to fire in Ozark oak-dominated forests of Arkansas. We repeatedly surveyed litter ants in replicate burned and unburned sites via Berlese extraction, baiting, and hand collecting 30-170 d postfire. We collected 6,301 ants representing 59 species. Cumulative ant species richness was lower in burned forests than in unburned forests. However, differences in average richness and abundance between treatments were inconsistent overtime; lower ant abundance and species richness in burned sites occurred only during the first few months postburn. Ant species composition was very similar between treatments, although some species typically associated within mesic and lowland habitats were found only in unburned forests. We conclude that litter ant communities in Ozark forests, as in other regions, are relatively resilient to the effects of prescribed burning. © 2013 Entomological Society of America.","abundance; Arkansas; community; disturbance; fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879610573

While open pine-grassland forests have diminished, acreage of pine plantations has increased throughout the Southeast, in part because of the U.S. Department of Agriculture Farm Bill conservation programs. To understand whether fire and herbicide treatments would be effective in creating pine-grassland structure in plantations suitable for a suite of declining early successional and pine-grassland adapted species, we evaluated combined effects of selective herbicide and prescribed fire on plant and bird communities in thinned, mid-rotation pine stands established under the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) in Mississippi, USA. Within each of the 12 replicate sites, we assigned 2 paired 8.1-ha plots to either treatment (herbicide + prescribed fire) or control in a randomized complete block design.We applied treatments during autumn and winter of 2002- 2003. During 2003-2006 breeding seasons, we characterized the bird community using repeated (4-6 repetitions/yr), standardized, 10-minute point counts from which we estimated species richness, total relative abundance, total avian conservation value, and density of select species. Managed plots exhibited reduced hardwood midstory and a greater abundance of grasses and forbs in the ground layer. Although avian species richness and total relative abundance were similar in treatment and control stands, we observed a shift in the bird community from closed-canopy forest species to early successional and pine-grassland adapted species, many of which are experiencing population declines. We recommend thinning, hardwood midstory control, and prescribed burning within CRP pine plantations to provide habitat for a suite of regionally declining bird species. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","Breeding-bird community; Conservation reserve program; Herbicide; Imazapyr; Loblolly pine plantation; Mid-rotation management; Mississippi; Pine-grassland; Pinus taeda; Prescribed fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878329806

In southern Chile, loss of native forest cover due to agricultural conversion may impact populations of Slender-billed Parakeets (Enicognathus leptorhynchus), endemic secondary cavity-nesting psittacids. Our objective was to assess nest-site selection by Slender-billed Parakeets in an agricultural-forest mosaic of southern Chile at two spatial scales: nest trees and the habitat surrounding those trees. During the 2008-2009 breeding seasons, we identified nest sites (N= 31) by observing parakeet behavior and using information provided by local residents. Most (29/31) nests were in mature Nothofagus obliqua trees. By comparing trees used for nesting with randomly selected, unused trees, we found that the probability of a tree being selected as a nest site was positively related to the number of cavity entrances, less dead crown, and more basal injuries (e.g., fire scars). At the nesting-habitat scale, nest site selection was positively associated with the extent of basal injuries and number of cavity entrances in trees within 50 m of nest trees. These variables are likely important because they allow nesting parakeets to minimize cavity search times in potential nesting areas, thereby reducing energetic demands and potential exposure to predators. Slender-billed Parakeets may thus use a hierarchical process to select nest sites; after a habitat patch is chosen, parakeets may then inspect individual trees in search of a suitable nest site. Effective strategies to ensure persistence of Slender-billed Parakeets in agricultural-forest mosaics should include preservation of both individual and groups of scattered mature trees. © 2013 The Authors.

Each site was a replicated experiment with a common design that compared an un-manipulated control, prescribed fire, mechanical and mechanical + fire treatments. Variables within the vegetation, fuelbed, forest floor and soil, bark beetles, tree diseases and wildlife were measured in 10-ha stands, and ecological response was compared among treatments at the site level, and across sites, to better understand the influence of differential site conditions. For most sites, treated stands were predicted to be more resilient to wildfire if it occurred shortly after treatment, but for most ecological variables, short-term response to treatments was subtle and transient. Strong site-specificity was observed in the response of most ecosystem variables, suggesting that practitioners employ adaptive management at the local scale. Because ecosystem components were tightly linked, adaptive management would need to include monitoring of a carefully chosen set of key variables. Mechanical treatments did not serve as surrogates for fire for most variables, suggesting that fire be maintained whenever possible. Restoration to pre-settlement conditions will require repeated treatments over time, with eastern forests requiring more frequent applications. © 2013 IAWF.","dry forest management; forest thinning; frequent fire regimes; mechanical treatment; oak; pine; prescribed fire; seasonally dry forests",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84873574598

Aquatic and moisture-sensitive species, such as amphibians, may be particularly vulnerable to these modified disturbance regimes because large wildfires often occur during extended droughts and thus may compound environmental threats. However, understanding of the effects of wildfires on amphibians in forests with long fire-return intervals is limited. Numerous stand-replacing wildfires have occurred since 1988 in Glacier National Park (Montana, U.S.A.), where we have conducted long-term monitoring of amphibians. We measured responses of 3 amphibian species to fires of different sizes, severity, and age in a small geographic area with uniform management. We used data from wetlands associated with 6 wildfires that burned between 1988 and 2003 to evaluate whether burn extent and severity and interactions between wildfire and wetland isolation affected the distribution of breeding populations. We measured responses with models that accounted for imperfect detection to estimate occupancy during prefire (0-4 years) and different postfire recovery periods. For the long-toed salamander (Ambystoma macrodactylum) and Columbia spotted frog (Rana luteiventris), occupancy was not affected for 6 years after wildfire. But 7-21 years after wildfire, occupancy for both species decreased ≥25% in areas where >50% of the forest within 500 m of wetlands burned. In contrast, occupancy of the boreal toad (Anaxyrus boreas) tripled in the 3 years after low-elevation forests burned. This increase in occupancy was followed by a gradual decline. Our results show that accounting for magnitude of change and time lags is critical to understanding population dynamics of amphibians after large disturbances. Our results also inform understanding of the potential threat of increases in wildfire frequency or severity to amphibians in the region. © 2012 Society for Conservation Biology.","Climate change; Colonization; Detection; Disturbance; Extinction; Fire severity; Isolation; Population dynamics",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872275718

Henslow's Sparrows have been documented to be unpredictable at breeding sites from year to year, but studies to date have considered only local spatial scales. We compared resettlement behavior (prevalence of occurrence and variation in abundance) of Henslow's Sparrows to that of two other grassland sparrows, grasshopper Sparrows (A. savannarum) and Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis), across multiple spatial resolutions. In Henslow's Sparrows, prevalence was lower and variation in abundance was greater than in the other two species.

These declines may be in part related to contemporary reductions in small-scale forest interior disturbances such as fire, windthrow, and treefalls. To mitigate the negative impacts of disturbance alteration and suppression on some late-successional species, strategies that emulate natural disturbance regimes are often advocated, but large-scale evaluations of these practices are rare. Here, we assessed the consequences of experimental disturbance (using partial timber harvest) on a severely declining late-successional species, the cerulean warbler (Setophaga cerulea), across the core of its breeding range in the Appalachian Mountains. We measured numerical (density), physiological (body condition), and demographic (age structure and reproduction) responses to three levels of disturbance and explored the potential impacts of disturbance on source-sink dynamics. Breeding densities of warblers increased one to four years after all canopy disturbances (vs. controls) and males occupying territories on treatment plots were in better condition than those on control plots. However, these beneficial effects of disturbance did not correspond to improvements in reproduction; nest success was lower on all treatment plots than on control plots in the southern region and marginally lower on light disturbance plots in the northern region. Our data suggest that only habitats in the southern region acted as sources, and interior disturbances in this region have the potential to create ecological traps at a local scale, but sources when viewed at broader scales. Thus, cerulean warblers would likely benefit from management that strikes a landscape-level balance between emulating natural disturbances in order to attract individuals into areas where current structure is inappropriate, and limiting anthropogenic disturbance in forests that already possess appropriate structural attributes in order to maintain maximum productivity.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871879675

These fires may aid restoration of vegetation structure and processes, which could improve conditions for wildlife species and reduce severe wildfire risk. Understanding response of wildlife species to fires is essential to forest restoration because contemporary fires may not have the same effects as historical fires. Recent fires in the Chiricahua Mountains of southeastern Arizona provided opportunity to investigate long-term effects of burn severity on habitat selection of a native wildlife species. We surveyed burned forest for squirrel feeding sign and related vegetation characteristics to frequency of feeding sign occurrence. We used radio-telemetry within fire-influenced forest to determine home ranges of Mexican fox squirrels, Sciurus nayaritensis chiricahuae, and compared vegetation characteristics within home ranges to random areas available to squirrels throughout burned conifer forest. Squirrels fed in forest with open understory and closed canopy cover. Vegetation within home ranges was characterized by lower understory density, consistent with the effects of low-severity fire, and larger trees than random locations. Our results suggest that return of low-severity fire can help restore habitat for Mexican fox squirrels and other native wildlife species with similar habitat affiliations in forests with a historical regime of frequent, low-severity fire. Our study contributes to an understanding of the role and impact of fire in forest ecosystems and the implications for forest restoration as fire returns to the region. © 2012 Society for Ecological Restoration International.","Arizona; Chiricahua fox squirrel; prescribed fire; Sciurus nayaritensis chiricahuae; severity; wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872685647

Removal of hardwood trees together with reintroduction of fire has been suggested as a method of restoring fire-suppressed longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests; however, this strategy, although widespread, has not been evaluated on large spatial and temporal scales. We used a landscape-scale experimental design to examine how bird assemblages in fire-suppressed longleaf pine sandhills responded to fire alone or fire following mechanical removal or herbicide application to reduce hardwood levels. Individual treatments were compared to fire-suppressed controls and reference sites. After initial treatment, all sites were managed with prescribed fire, on an approximately two- to three-year interval, for over a decade. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling ordinations suggested that avian assemblages on sites that experienced any form of hardwood removal differed from assemblages on both firesuppressed sites and reference sites 3-4 years after treatment (i.e., early posttreatment). After >10 years of prescribed burning on all sites (i.e., late posttreatment), only assemblages at sites treated with herbicide were indistinguishable from assemblages at reference sites. By the end of the study, individual species that were once indicators of reference sites no longer contributed to making reference sites unique. Occupancy modeling of these indicator species also demonstrated increasing similarity across treatments over time. Overall, although we documented long-term and variable assemblage-level change, our results indicate occupancy for birds considered longleaf pine specialists was similar at treatment and reference sites after over a decade of prescribed burning, regardless of initial method of hardwood removal. In other words, based on the response of species highly associated with the habitat, we found no justification for the added cost and effort of fire surrogates; fire alone was sufficient to restore these species. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.","Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, USA; Longleaf pine; Nonmetric multidimensional scaling; Occupancy modeling; Picoides borealis; Pinus palustris; Prescribed fire; Red-cockaded Woodpecker",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875801324

Yet large snags are often removed for their commercial and firewood values. Consequently we evaluated effects of human access on snag densities and diameter-class distributions at nine locations in ponderosa pine forests throughout the interior western United States. We found no relationship between small-diameter (23-50 cm diam breast ht [dbh]) snags and human access measures (i.e., road density, distance to nearest town, and topography). However, large-snag (50 cm dbh) density was best predicted by road density, which suggested a decline, on average, of 0.7 large snags/ha for every km of road/km2. Most locations had relatively high densities of small-diameter snags (<23 cm dbh) and diminishing density as diameter class increased. Idaho and Colorado study locations had higher snag densities in the largest diameter classes compared with remaining locations. These locations experienced minimal commercial timber harvest, were situated far from towns, and had few or no roads. Persistence of large-diameter snags and adequate snag densities for wildlife requires consideration of human access characteristics at coarse spatial scales. Snag management guidelines may need to incorporate these measures and focus more on retention of large-diameter snags than minimum density targets. © 2013 The Wildlife Society.","Cavity-user; Human access; Ponderosa pine; Road density; Snag densities; Snag diameter distribution; Wildlife habitat",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84926395216

Den Latham’s Painting the Landscape with Fire describes this phenomenon but also tells a different story, one that reveals the role of fire ecology in healthy, dynamic forests. Fire is a beneficial element which allows the longleaf forests of America’s Southeast to survive. In recent decades, foresters and landowners have become intensely aware of the need to “put enough fire on the ground” to preserve longleaf habitat for red-cockaded woodpeckers, quail, wild turkeys, and a host of other plants and animals. Painting the Landscape with Fire is a hands-on-primer for those who want to understand the role of fire in longleaf forests. Latham joins wildlife biologists, foresters, wildfire fighters, and others as they band and translocate endangered birds, survey snake populations, improve wildlife habitat, and conduct prescribed burns on public and private lands. Painting the Landscape with Fire explores the unique southern biosphere of longleaf forests. Throughout, Latham beautifully tells the story of the resilience of these woodlands and of the resourcefulness of those who work to see them thrive.

The main causes of degradation include unsustainable logging, agriculture, invasive species, fire, fuelwood gathering, and livestock grazing. Forest degradation is widespread and has become an important consideration in global policy processes that deal with biodiversity, climate change, and forest management. There is, however, no generally recognized way to identify a degraded forest because perceptions of forest degradation vary depending on the cause, the particular goods or services of interest, and the temporal and spatial scales considered. Here, we suggest that there are types of forest degradation that produce a continuum of decline in provision of ecosystem services, from those in primary forests through various forms of managed forests to deforestation. Forest degradation must be measured against a desired baseline condition, and the types of degradation can be represented using five criteria that relate to the drivers of degradation, loss of ecosystem services and sustainable management, including: productivity, biodiversity, unusual disturbances, protective functions, and carbon storage. These criteria are not meant to be equivalent and some might be considered more important than others, depending on the local forest management objectives. We propose a minimum subset of seven indicators for the five criteria that should be assessed to determine forest degradation under a sustainable ecosystem management regime. The indicators can be remotely sensed (although improving calibration requires ground work) and aggregated from stand to management unit or landscape levels and ultimately to sub-national and national scales. © 2013 by the author(s).","Biodiversity; Carbon; Criteria and indicators; Forest degradation; Forest management; Remote sensing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84881144989

Because fire events are highly unpredictable, forest managers are reluctant to proactively reduce harvest targets, as it results in an immediate revenue loss. We explored a simple but proactive way of including the risks and uncertainties of fire in forest management planning through the identification of low productivity forest areas most vulnerable to fire in two different boreal forest zones. Site index and relative density index were used to estimate the time required to reach different harvesting thresholds based on stem size and tree density. We varied the production objective by using three different thresholds of minimum stem size (dm 3/tree) and stand yield (m 3/ha) (50 dm 3/tree - 50 m 3/ha, 70 dm 3/tree - 70 m 3/ha, 90 dm 3/tree - 90 m 3/ha). We estimated the time required to reach these thresholds and the proportion of forest zone that could exceed them. Fire cycle length was then used to assess the survival likelihood (probability of reaching the threshold at the stand scale when considering fire risk). An alternative rate of return was also used as an indicator of profit exposure to fire risk. When survival likelihood and alternative rate of return are considered jointly with time-declining interest rates, minimum survival likelihoods need to be higher for longer fire cycles. The proportion of stands vulnerable to fire served to decide whether or not to include fire risk into strategic planning. The identification of major break points in the vulnerability assessment also helped to decide which minimum harvesting threshold is appropriate as a function of the productivity characteristics and fire cycle of the forest under management. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Traps represent a new threat to the conservation of native species, yet little attention has been given to developing practical approaches to eliminating them. In the northern Rocky Mountains of Montana, Olive-sided Flycatchers (Contopus cooperi) prefer to settle in patches of selectively harvested forest versus burned forest despite the lower reproductive success and higher nest predation risk associated with the former habitat. I investigated characteristics of preferred perch sites for this species and how these preferences varied between habitats and sexes. I then built on previous research to develop a range of management prescriptions for reducing the attractiveness of selectively harvested forest, thereby disarming the ecological trap. Female flycatchers preferred to forage from shorter perch trees than males, and females' perches were shorter than other available perch trees. Both sexes preferred standing dead perch trees (snags) and these preferences were most obvious in harvested forest where snags are rarer. Because previous research shows that snag density is linked to habitat preference and spruce/fir trees are preferred nest substrate, my results suggest these two habitat components are focal habitat selection cues. I suggest alternative and complementary strategies for eliminating the ecological trap for Olive-sided Flycatchers including: (1) reduced retention and creation of snags, (2) avoiding selective harvest in spruce, fir, and larch stands, (3) avoiding retention of these tree species, and (4) selecting only even-aged canopy height trees for retention so as to reduce perch availability for female flycatchers. Because these strategies also have potential to negatively impact habitat suitability for other forest species or even create new ecological traps, we urge caution in the application of our management recommendations. © 2012 by the author(s).","Behavioral management; Disturbance-dependent; Evolutionary trap; Habitat preference; Selective logging; Wildfire",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871696237

Sites investigated included various burning regimes, wildland-urban-interface (WUI), a college campus, and an unmanaged area. Amblyomma americanum (L.) (Acari: Ixodidae) dominated the tick population while Ixodes scapularis Say was not encountered. There were complex differences in tick populations among site conditions. After prescribed burning, the tick population size was small but was larger in subsequent 2- and 5-year post-burn sites. An increase in Odocoileus virginianus foraging in recently burned sites is likely responsible for this phenomenon. WUI areas had the largest tick populations likely due to Odocoileus virginianus activity in an area that provides cover, forage, and a connection to a wildlife refuge. It is possible that the likelihood of humans coming in contact with ticks and tick-borne diseases is greater in WUI areas than in unbroken contiguous forest. A. americanum showed a positive correlation with percent cover of grass and leaf litter mass and a negative relationship with pine sapling density. Variables expected to be strongly correlated with A. americanum populations such as soil moisture, canopy closure, and tree density were found to have weak correlations. © 2012 The Society for Vector Ecology.","Amblyomma americanum; Prescribed fire; White-tailed deer; Wildland-urban-interface",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870257397

Some are opportunistic feeders, while others are closely associated with burned forests. This distinction is important for developing sound postfire forest management aimed at conserving biodiversity, as concerns should be mostly directed towards burn-associated saproxylic beetles rather than opportunistic species. Here, we examine species-habitat associations, temporal dynamics, and community structure of saproxylic beetles in black spruce and jack pine stands disturbed by wildfire and by a ""non-fire"" disturbance generated by girdling trees to mimic the small-scale gap dynamics characterizing old-growth boreal forests in Canada. We used flightinterception traps and reared logs to compare abundance, species richness, and species composition of saproxylic beetles among treatments. We found that over 30% of saproxylic beetles had an affinity with jack pine or black spruce affected by either fire or girdling. Assemblages consistently differed between disturbance types over the 3 y of the study. We found that successional changes in species composition were more pronounced in burned sites than those with the girdling treatment, which indicates that the contribution of fire-generated habitats to regional diversity increases over time. While postfire forests are notable for their early-colonizing saproxylic species, our results show that they can also have substantial value for supporting mid-successional species such as Acmaeops pratensis, which is already on European red lists. This forewarns us about long-term negative consequences that postfire salvage logging could have for certain species.","burn-associated species; deadwood; emergence cage; fire ecology; girdling; saproxylic beetles",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84874889454

On Oleron 80% of singing males were contacted in wooded areas. By modelling the effect of habitat traits we showed that the density of singing males was positively influenced by the importance of wooded areas and negatively influenced by urbanized areas. This situation is in contrast with what has been described elsewhere for the Scops Owl, particularly in the Mediterranean region where this species is much more linked to urbanized areas.

However, many ecosystems are experiencing increasingly rapid loss of large trees or a failure to recruit new large trees or both. We quantify this problem in a globally iconic ecosystem in southeastern Australia - forests dominated by the world's tallest angiosperms, Mountain Ash (Eucalyptus regnans). Tree, stand and landscape-level factors influencing the death and collapse of large living cavity trees and the decay and collapse of dead trees with cavities are documented using a suite of long-term datasets gathered between 1983 and 2011. The historical rate of tree mortality on unburned sites between 1997 and 2011 was >14% with a mortality spike in the driest period (2006-2009). Following a major wildfire in 2009, 79% of large living trees with cavities died and 57-100% of large dead trees were destroyed on burned sites. Repeated measurements between 1997 and 2011 revealed no recruitment of any new large trees with cavities on any of our unburned or burned sites. Transition probability matrices of large trees with cavities through increasingly decayed condition states projects a severe shortage of large trees with cavities by 2039 that will continue until at least 2067. This large cavity tree crisis in Mountain Ash forests is a product of: (1) the prolonged time required (>120 years) for initiation of cavities; and (2) repeated past wildfires and widespread logging operations. These latter factors have resulted in all landscapes being dominated by stands ≤72 years and just 1.16% of forest being unburned and unlogged. We discuss how the features that make Mountain Ash forests vulnerable to a decline in large tree abundance are shared with many forest types worldwide.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84867181863

As decomposers of woody material, polypores are ecologically important ecosystem engineers. The ecology and conservation biology of polypores have been studied intensively in boreal coniferous forests. However, only a few studies have focused on the species living on broadleaved trees. To increase knowledge on this species group we conducted polypore surveys in 27 broadleaved forests and 303 forest compartments (539 ha) on the southern boreal zone in Finland and measured dead wood and forest characteristics. We detected altogether 98 polypore species, of which 13 are red-listed in Finland. 60% of the recorded species are primarily associated with broadleaved trees. The number of species in a local community present in a broadleaved forest covered approximately 50 species, of which 30-40 were primarily associated with broadleaved trees. The size of the inventoried area explained 67% of the variation in the species richness, but unlike in previous studies conducted in coniferous forests, dead wood variables as well as forest structure had very limited power in explaining polypore species richness on forest stand level. The compartments occupied by red listed Protomerulius caryae had an especially high volume of living birch, but otherwise the occurrences of red-listed species could not be predicted based on the forest structure.","Birch; Deciduous; Slash and burn; Species-area relationship; Wood-inhabiting fungi",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84866936309

Although most theory and application have been based on in situ measurements, imaging technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) provide measurements that are both vertically accurate and horizontally extensive. We use small-footprint, multiple-return lidar from a state-wide dataset (1-m footprint, 0.11point/m 2) to characterize the vertical and horizontal structure of successional loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and mature, fire-maintained longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests on the coastal plain of North Carolina, USA. The relationship between these characteristics and the federally-endangered red-cockaded woodpecker's (Picoides borealis, Vieillot) habitat preferences were assessed; as this species has a strong affinity for mature longleaf pine forests. Vertical structure was characterized by lidar-derived metrics (e.g., average and standard deviation of canopy height) and horizontal patterns of vertical structure were quantified by semivariograms and lacunarity analysis. Lidar metrics were compared with field measurements of stand structure and with woodpecker habitat use. We predicted woodpecker distribution using the Maxent species distribution modeling algorithm with elevation, landcover, and hydrography geospatial variables, with and without lidar-derived structural variables. Lidar successfully quantified canopy variation and differentiated between the structural characteristics of these two similar coniferous evergreen forest types (e.g. significant differences in maximum height, canopy cover, and size classes). Loblolly stands were found to have the tallest trees on average with a higher canopy cover. Both semivariograms and lacunarity analyses clearly differentiated between evergreen forest structural types (e.g. semivariogram range was 18.7m for longleaf, 32.3m for loblolly). By examining the immediate area around cavity nesting sites we found taller trees than those found across broader foraging sites. The species distribution model accurately predicted woodpecker distribution (tested with woodpecker presence, AUC&gt;.85). The addition of lidar-derived variables improved the model's predictive power by 8% compared to the model based only on elevation, landcover, and hydrography environmental variables. We show that relatively low density lidar data are valuable for wildlife studies by characterizing and separating similar canopy types, describing different use zones (foraging vs. nesting), and for use in species distribution models. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Forest structure; Lidar remote sensing; Loblolly pine; Longleaf pine; Pinus palustris; Red-cockaded woodpecker",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863835215

By contrast, many natricine snakes use chemical cues to initiate predation, increasing the rate of tongue flicking regardless of whether visual cues are present. The present study examined the individual and interactive effects of chemical and visual stimuli of prey on the predatory behavior of five snake taxa representing three feeding guilds.

We conducted a 5-year study on the Osceola National Forest in northeastern Florida to determine how dormant-season prescribed burns at different frequencies (annual, biennial, quadrennial or unburned) applied over a 40-year period affected coarse woody debris volume, decomposition and nitrogen content, and subterranean termite (Reticulitermes spp.) activity. Burn frequency had no effect on standing dead tree or log volumes. However, freshly cut longleaf pine logs placed in the plots for four years lost significantly less mass in annually burned plots than in unburned plots. The annual exponential decay coefficient estimate from all logs was 0.14 yr -1 (SE = 0.01), with the estimated times for 50 and 95% loss being 5 and 21.4 years, respectively.

Fire influences hollow availability, and the associated indirect effects on fauna can threaten the persistence of hollow-dependent species in fire-prone systems. We investigated the influence of two temporal aspects of fire regimes (time-since-fire, inter-fire interval) on hollow occurrence in a semi-arid, fire-prone region in south-eastern Australia. Empirical data on the characteristics of hollow-bearing eucalypt stems and fire-history attributes were compiled for 581 study sites. Mixed models were used to examine the relative influence of time-since-fire and inter-fire interval on hollow occurrence. Time-since-fire and inter-fire interval both affected the probability of hollow occurrence, but in different ways. Time-since-fire influenced the occurrence of hollows in live and dead stems. As time-since-fire increased, so too did the probability of live and dead stems containing hollows. Live stems did not provide hollows before 40. years post-fire, while the probability of dead stems containing hollows peaked at 50-60. years. Inter-fire interval influenced the availability of hollows in dead stems. Longer inter-fire intervals resulted in an increased density of dead hollow-bearing stems. In this region, hollow-dependent fauna will benefit from increased fire-free periods, both in terms of individual fire events and the intervals between repeated fires. These results highlight the complex way in which fire affects the availability of faunal habitat resources, and the extended time periods over which such influences operate. Understanding the effects of fire regimes on slow-developing habitat resources over long time-frames is imperative for sound ecological fire management. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Australia; Fauna habitat; Fire chronosequence; Fire frequency; Fire regime; Tree cavity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862694428

These effects are of particular concern in forests of western North America, where intensive herbivory by native and domestic ungulates has the potential to substantially reduce or eliminate deciduous, highly palatable species of aspen (Populus tremuloides), cottonwood (Populus trichocarpa), and willow (Salix spp.). In turn, differential herbivory pressure may favor greater establishment of unpalatable conifers that serve as ladder fuels for stand-replacing fires. The resulting high fuel loads often require silvicultural fuels reductions to mitigate fire risk, which in turn may facilitate additional recruitment of deciduous species but also additional herbivory pressure. Potential interactions of ungulate herbivory with episodic disturbances of silviculture, fire, and other land uses are not well documented, but are thought to operate synergistically to affect forest dynamics. We evaluated individual and joint effects of ungulate herbivory and fuels reduction treatments in grand fir (Abies grandis) and Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menziezii) forests that dominate large areas of interior western North America. We applied fuels reduction treatments of mechanical thinning and prescribed fire and then evaluated the responses of aspen, cottonwood, and willow species to these treatments (N=3) versus areas of no treatment (N=3), and to exclusion from ungulate herbivory versus areas subjected to extant herbivory by free-ranging cattle (Bos taurus), elk (Cervus elaphus), and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus). Densities of deciduous species were >4 times higher in response to fuels reduction treatments (84.4. individuals/ha) compared to areas of no treatment (19.7. individuals/ha). Additionally, when ungulates were excluded from fuels treated sites, the density of cottonwood was >5 times higher (122.5. individuals/ha) than fuels treated sites subjected to extant herbivory (24.3. individuals/ha). Similarly, densities of Populus spp. and Salix spp. were >3 times higher (211.6. individuals/ha) on fuels treated sites excluded from ungulate herbivory versus fuels treated sites subjected to extant herbivory (66.1. stems/ha). Deciduous species subjected to extant ungulate herbivory also were significantly lower in height, canopy surface area, and canopy volume than the same species inside the ungulate exclosures. Recruitment and long-term survival of aspen, cottonwood, and willow species in coniferous forests of interior western North America require a combination of episodic disturbances such as silviculture and fire to facilitate deciduous plant recruitment, followed by reductions in grazing pressure by domestic and wild ungulates during the time intervals between episodic disturbances to facilitate plant establishment, growth and survival. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.","Chronic disturbances; Fire; Forest dynamics; Fuels reduction; Grazing; Ungulates",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859790965

To address this informational need, we studied seaside sparrows (Ammodramus maritimus) in Dorchester County, Maryland, where prescribed marsh burning has been conducted since at least the 1930s. We compared the effects of 4 fire treatments (<1 yr since burn, 1-2 yr since burn, 3-4 yr since burn, and ≥5 yr since burn) on seaside sparrow density and reproductive output, and examined the impact of fire treatment, nest-site characteristics, and weather on nest survival from 2007 to 2009. We found that nest and territory densities were greatest on marshes <1 year post-burn, indicating that burning did not displace seaside sparrows. Nest and territory densities also declined as time since burn increased, and were about 50% less on marshes that were ≥5 years post-burn compared to marshes <1 year post-burn. Egg density (the number of eggs produced per ha) was 50% greater on marshes burned <1 year ago than on marshes burned 3-4 years ago, but we found no difference in fledgling density, indicating that predation may have disproportionately affected recently-burned marshes. Study year and percent cover of smooth cordgrass (Spartina alterniflora) best explained nest survival, which was lowest in 2009, a year with high precipitation and tides. We recommend that prescribed burning continue to be used at 1-4 year intervals to maintain habitat quality for breeding seaside sparrows in the mid-Atlantic, but suggest that the effects of fire management may be less influential than predicted impacts of global climate change.

This approach assumes that disturbances are responsible for the structure of biological communities and that appropriate application of the disturbance will ensure the persistence of native plants and animals. If species in a community do not respond predictably to variation in disturbance regime, then management strategies based on emulating disturbance may fail to ensure the persistence of all species. In this study, we examined the efficacy of using prescribed fire as a tool for managing populations of breeding and wintering birds in the pine rocklands of southern Florida. We found that variation in fire history had little effect on vegetation structure and no effect on bird abundance. Instead, vegetation structure was more closely associated with water-table elevation and soil type, whereas most of the observed variation in the structure of bird assemblages appeared to be a function of degree of urbanization in the landscape. That the structure and composition of bird assemblages was independent of variation in fire history suggests that manipulating the fire regime, at least within the range of variability observed in this study, is unlikely to prove effective as a means to manage bird populations. In general, our results argue for caution in assuming that a single process can be used to control the structure of biological communities, especially in systems where landscapes have been substantially altered by human activity.","Florida; hydrology; pine rocklands; prescribed fire; slash pine",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865425926

However, assessments of treatment effectiveness may be improved with a more rigorous accounting of the fuel characteristics. We present two case studies to introduce a relatively new approach to characterizing fuels and predicting potential fire behavior, fuel consumption, and emissions in Southern forests using the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS) and Consume. The first case study provides fine-scale (&lt;100. ha) examples of fuel treatments (prescribed fire, mechanical thinning, mastication, and herbicide treatment) and their potential effect on predicted fire behavior and effects on measured treatment units. The second case study evaluates potential fire behavior across a managed forest landscape (74,000. ha) in the upper Atlantic Coastal Plain, South Carolina.Results from the fine-scale assessment indicate that fuel treatments reduce reaction intensity, rate of spread, and flamelength by up to 58%, 57%, and 63%, respectively. Fuel loading of strata that control surface fire behavior (i.e., shrubs, grasses, fine woody fuels, and litter) range from 32.0Mgha -1 in the thinned, untreated unit to 8.5Mgha -1 in the unthinned unit treated with herbicides and prescribed fire. Based on model predictions, up to 80% less fuel would be consumed with concomitant reduction in emissions during a wildfire occurring in the treated units compared to the untreated unit.Assessments of potential fire behavior across the study area indicate that overall hazard is low to moderate for this forested landscape. However, localized areas of high surface fire and crown fire potential were identified. Plot- and stand-based modeling both suggest that the potential for high to extreme fire behavior exists for this landscape. Combined, the two case studies highlight the ability of the FCCS to represent measured fuel characteristics and predict differences in potential fire behavior resulting from fuel treatments. Even small differences in fuel characteristics resulting from fuel treatments or site variation could be detected, allowing the effects of both ecological processes and management actions to be quantified. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Fire behavior; Fire hazard; Fuel Characteristic Classification System; Fuel treatment effectiveness; Longleaf pine; Southeastern United States",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859218464

However, it strongly affects bird communities and is generally considered to be detrimental for bird conservation. In Europe, many open-habitat species are currently declining owing to land use changes. Wildfires, which are common disturbances in the Mediterranean Basin, can create suitable habitat for these species but the effect of postfire salvage logging on bird communities is unknown. 2.We surveyed breeding birds in two burned secondary pine forests from the western Mediterranean Basin and analysed the effect of salvage logging and vegetation regeneration as determinants of individual species and community parameters. We used a pseudoexperimental before-after-control-impact approach to study the changes in the bird community during the first three springs after fire. 3.Most bird species were affected by salvage logging (measured by snag density), a relationship that was positive for forest birds and negative for open-habitat species. Species linked to shrub and edge habitats were positively affected by vegetation regrowth. Bird communities in logged areas held more species of conservation concern than those in unlogged areas. Species richness and overall density tended to decrease from the first to the second year after fire and to increase from the second to the third. 4.Salvage logging benefits a number of open-habitat species, although its effect on bird conservation depends strongly on the specific threats that birds face in each region or ecosystem. 5.Synthesis and applications. In the Mediterranean Basin, some postfire salvage logging of pine forests can be compatible with bird conservation. We recommend that managers retain some standing dead trees during logging operations and that logged forest is interspersed with unlogged stands. This will provide suitable habitat for the widest range of species. © 2012 The Authors.

In the southeastern United States, rapid vegetation growth coupled with complex land use history and forest management options requires a dynamic approach to fuel characterization. In this study we assessed potential surface fire behavior with the Fuel Characteristic Classification System (FCCS), a tool which uses inventoried fuelbed inputs to predict fire behavior.Using inventory data from 629 plots established in the upper Atlantic Coastal Plain, South Carolina, we constructed FCCS fuelbeds representing median fuel characteristics by major forest type and age class. With a dry fuel moisture scenario and 6.4kmh -1 midflame wind speed, the FCCS predicted moderate to high potential fire hazard for the majority of the fuelbeds under study. To explore fire hazard under potential future fuel conditions, we developed fuelbeds representing the range of quantitative inventory data for fuelbed components that drive surface fire behavior algorithms and adjusted shrub species composition to represent 30% and 60% relative cover of highly flammable shrub species.Results indicate that the primary drivers of surface fire behavior vary by forest type, age and surface fire behavior rating. Litter tends to be a primary or secondary driver in most forest types. In comparison to other surface fire contributors, reducing shrub loading results in reduced flame lengths most consistently across forest types. FCCS fuelbeds and the results from this project can be used for fire hazard mitigation planning throughout the southern Atlantic Coastal Plain where similar forest types occur. The approach of building simulated fuelbeds across the range of available surface fuel data produces sets of incrementally different fuel characteristics that can be applied to any dynamic forest types in which surface fuel conditions change rapidly. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Fuel Characteristic Classification System; Fuel characteristics; Fuel load; Fuel reduction; Southeastern United States; Surface fire behavior",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859215822

Composed of 12 sites, the FFS is a comprehensive multidisciplinary experiment designed to evaluate the costs and ecological consequences of alternative fuel reduction treatments in seasonally dry forests of the United States. The FFS has a common experimental design across the 12-site network, with each site a fully replicated experiment that compares four treatments: prescribed fire, mechanical treatments, mechanical + prescribed fire, and an unmanipulated control. We measured treatment cost and variables within several components of the ecosystem, including vegetation, the fuel bed, soils, bark beetles, tree diseases, and wildlife in the same 10-ha experimental units. This design allowed us to assemble a fairly comprehensive picture of ecosystem response to treatment at the site scale, and to compare treatment response across a wide variety of conditions. Results of 206 technical articles on short-term findings are summarized here, with the following general conclusions: (1) For most sites, treatments modified stand structures and fuels to the point where posttreatment stands would be expected to be much more resistant to moderate wildfire. (2) For the great majority of ecosystem components, including the vegetation, soils, and animal species, short-term responses to treatments were subtle and transient. (3) Comparison of fire risk reduction and ecological effects between 1-year and several years posttreatment suggests that while effects tend to dampen with time, fire risk increases, owing to treatment-induced collapse of burned portions of stands. (4) Each multivariate analysis conducted has demonstrated that critical components of these ecosystems are strongly linked, suggesting that managers would be prudent to conduct fuel reduction work with the entire ecosystem in mind. (5) Multisite analyses generally show strong site-specific effects for many ecosystem components, which reduces the broad applicability of findings, and suggests that practitioners might do well to employ adaptive management at the local or regional scale. (6) Mechanical treatments do not serve as surrogates for fire for the great majority of ecosystem components, suggesting that fire could be introduced and maintained as a process in these systems whenever possible. (7) For research to best inform management on fuel reduction strategies through time, longer measurement times posttreatment are needed, as well as repeated applications of treatments; short-term results of the FFS are insufficient to comment on long-term ecosystem trajectories.","Dry forests; Forest thinning; Fuel reduction; Prescribed fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862274003

Our objective was to examine how life history traits, short-term global change perturbations, and long-term climate change interact to affect the likely persistence of an oak species - Quercus engelmannii (Engelmann oak). Specifically, we combined dynamic species distribution models, which predict suitable habitat, with stochastic, stage-based metapopulation models, which project population trajectories, to evaluate the effects of three global change factors - climate change, land use change, and altered fire frequency - emphasizing the roles of dispersal and seed predation. Our model predicted dramatic reduction in Q. engelmannii abundance, especially under drier climates and increased fire frequency. When masting lowers seed predation rates, decreased masting frequency leads to large abundance decreases. Current rates of dispersal are not likely to prevent these effects, although increased dispersal could mitigate population declines. The results suggest that habitat suitability predictions by themselves may under-estimate the impact of climate change for other species and locations. © 2012 Conlisk et al.",,Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862088551

This woodpecker responds positively to large-scale fire disturbances and may be at risk from logging and post-fire management. With 100 radio-locations of four adult males, we used resource-selection probability functions in logistic form in an information-theoretic framework to model the Black-backed Woodpecker's selection of foraging habitat at fine and coarse spatial scales. Fine-scale data included characteristics of the foraging tree (tree level) and local habitat surrounding foraging trees (plot level, 0.04 ha), whereas coarse-scale data (224-778 ha) included patch characteristics within home ranges. Model selection by Akaike's information criterion identified a multi-scale model containing tree- and plot-level covariates, and their interaction, as the best model to characterize foraging trees. The positive effect of interaction between foraging-tree diameter and plot-level tree density suggested that foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers select both patches with dense trees and larger-diameter trees. Fire severity was not important, possibly because of the time since fire and the birds' habit of foraging on recently dead trees in adjacent unburned forests. Salvage logging that retains large-diameter trees in clumped distributions is most likely to provide long-term foraging habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers in dry coniferous forests of the interior western U.S. Following wildfire, conservation of forest patches containing weakened trees may extend the suitability of habitat for foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers by up to 8 years. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2012.","Black-backed Woodpecker; Foraging habitat selection; Idaho; Picoides arcticus; Remote sensing; Resource-selection probability function; Wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862303807

Open woodlands with understories dominated by herbaceous vegetation benefit many wildlife species, but maintaining these woodlands requires frequent burning. Although many studies have compared herpetofaunal responses in burned forests to unburned forests, fewer studies have examined changes in the herpetofaunal community during the interval between short-rotation prescribed burns. We examined changes in habitat and relative abundance of reptiles and amphibians each year within a 3-year burn cycle in nine restored pine woodlands of western Arkansas, USA. Overall numbers of reptiles did not change among the three burn years; however, capture rates for one snake species (southern black racer [. Coluber constrictor priapus]) and three lizards differed among the three post-burn years. Overall capture rate for anurans and all amphibians combined was greatest the first year after burning, mostly because captures of dwarf American toads (Bufo americanus charlessmithi) were substantially greater in stands the first year after burning. Salamander captures were infrequent. Capture rates of most reptile and amphibian species declined over the 3-year sampling period. Only minor changes in capture rate occurred among the 36 species we evaluated during the intervening years between frequent burns. Capture rates for only two species were lower the first year after fire. Although not all herpetofaunal species benefited from frequent fire, most species appeared to tolerate the frequent burning necessary for maintaining open pine woodlands in the Ouachita Mountains. © 2012.","Amphibians; Arkansas; Burning; Fire; Lizards; Snakes",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84857669538

However, this basic task is often complicated by the rarity of the species in question and the limited availability of high quality environmental data. The endangered Black-capped Vireo (Vireo atricapilla) occupies early seral shrub communities generated by fire. The ability to predict vegetation structure is particularly important for mapping vireo habitat because this species occupies transitional, non-equilibrium vegetation types. We use presence data for territorial male vireos collected throughout the Fort Hood Military Reservation, Texas, to construct habitat suitability models using vegetation type (mapped from aerial imagery), soil data, and laser altimetry (LiDAR)-derived measures of vegetation structure. LiDAR produces a three-dimensional, high-resolution representation of vegetation structure across broad spatial scales. We built models that incorporated LIDAR outputs as well as the other habitat predictors using a non-parametric machine-learning algorithm, cforest. Models built using a single predictor class (vegetation structure or type or soil) performed similarly across 25 bootstrapped training and test datasets (median accuracies 76%, 74%, and 79%, respectively). Models incorporating two predictor classes performed better (80-81%) and only slightly worse than the full model (82%). Furthermore, vegetation type and soil data were more important predictors of habitat suitability than structural measures in the full model. Predictive maps suggest that models incorporating vegetation type and soil would be most useful for habitat conservation and management applications on Fort Hood. The addition of LiDAR-derived variables to the model further distinguishes suitable habitats from potentially suitable but presently overgrown areas. In the absence of detailed vegetation data, models based on structural measures performed well when combined with soil data. This could be useful in a broader regional context in which vireos occupy a greater variety of vegetation types with a common structure. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.","Aerial altimetry; Aerial imagery; Black-capped vireo; Cforest; LiDAR; Variable importance; Vegetation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855779512

In California oak woodlands, encroachment by the more shade-tolerant native Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) is particularly common, and results in the piercing and eventual overtopping of crowns of shade-intolerant trees. We investigated canopy competition, paired tree ages, and post-fire effects in a recently burned, encroached California black oak (Quercus kelloggii) woodland. Pre-fire woodland overstory was heavily dominated by Douglas-fir, which commonly pierced and overtopped California black oak crowns. Trees that pierced overstory oak crowns were younger (mean difference = 43.6. years, p< 0.001) than their paired oaks. Fire effects were variable, leaving some areas unchanged and others with complete above-ground stem mortality. Although above-ground stem-kill was often high for California black oak, the majority (82%) re-sprouted from the root collar. Logistic modeling revealed a significant relationship between California black oak mortality and neighboring Douglas-fir height and plot heat load index. The probability of California black oak mortality increased as neighboring Douglas-fir height increased and decreased with increasing heat load index. Probability of mortality for Douglas-fir decreased with increasing tree size, while the probability of California black oak top-kill was much higher than that for 20-30. cm. dbh Douglas-fir across a continuous measure of char height. Results indicate that competitive pressure from encroaching trees may compromise California black oak's ability to survive fire while resilience of encroaching Douglas-fir improves with greater size. Caution should be taken when planning and implementing restoration activities in California black oak woodlands to minimize loss of compromised, remnant oaks while still achieving adequate removal of encroaching conifers. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Ecological restoration; Fire exclusion; Oak woodland; Positive feedbacks; Tree mortality",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856503006

The main goals of the present study are to determine the most critical period for breeding output and to investigate factors influencing reproductive efficiency of the studied population. The mean survival rate of the whole nesting period (day 52 from egg laying to day 20 of nestlings life) was 0.668 (95% CL: 0.611-0.725) and did not differ between years, while mean survival for incubation period was 0.721 (0.681-0.761) and also was not significantly different between years. Finally, the mean survival rate for the nestling period was 0.903 (0.869-0.937) and was different between years. This study shows that the most critical period in the breeding cycle is the time of incubation and the first days of the nestling's life. The period from egg laying to day 20 of the nestling's life is characterised by the highest hazard ratio.

In contrast, the forests colonizing the moist, higher elevations and shaded slopes had a higher diversity of tree species with greater basal area, higher proportion of deadwood, and more regenerating trees; here the coniferous shade trees experienced infrequent but destructive treetop fires.

Knowledge of temporal changes in the occurrence of species after fire is essential for conservation management in fireprone environments. Two key issues are: whether postfire responses of species are idiosyncratic or if multiple species show a limited number of similar responses; and whether such responses to time since fire can predict the occurrence of species across broad spatial scales. We examined the response of bird species to time since fire in semiarid shrubland in southeastern Australia using data from surveys at 499 sites representing a 100-year chronosequence. We used nonlinear regression to model the probability of occurrence of 30 species with time since fire in two vegetation types, and compared species' responses with generalized response shapes from the literature. The occurrence of 16 species was significantly influenced by time since fire: they displayed six main responses consistent with generalized response shapes. Of these 16 species, 15 occurred more frequently in mid-or later-successional vegetation (>20 years since fire), and only one species occurred more often in early succession (<5 years since fire). The models had reasonable predictive ability for eight species, some predictive ability for seven species, and were little better than random for one species. Bird species displayed a limited range of responses to time since fire; thus a small set of fire ages should allow the provision of habitat for most species. Postfire successional changes extend for decades and management of the age class distribution of vegetation will need to reflect this timescale. Response curves revealed important seral stages for species and highlighted the importance of mid-to late-successional vegetation (.20 years). Although time since fire clearly influences the distribution of numerous bird species, predictive models of the spatial distribution of species in fire-prone landscapes need to incorporate other factors in addition to time since fire. © 2012 by the Ecological Society of America.","Birds; Chronosequence; Conservation; Disturbance; Fire; Mallee; Semiarid shrubland; Southeastern Australia; Succession; Time since fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84859539284

We present the dynamic reference concept, an approach that quantitatively incorporates the temporal and spatial variation of reference ecosystems such that targets reflect ecological dynamism. Success is measured by simultaneously quantifying changes in reference and restoration sites over time. To illustrate the practical application of this concept, we present a case study of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) restoration on Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, USA. We use Mahalanobis distance with non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination to quantify the dynamic nature of reference plots and the extent to which restoration sites move toward them. Reference ecosystems were first defined by expert judgment and ecological models including maximum entropy. We then further refined restoration targets through data analysis using Mahalanobis distance to determine plots that were within the 90% confidence region of initial benchmark species composition. Species composition of benchmark sites was more resilient than restoration sites, i.e., changing less with a natural disturbance regime of frequent fire. Restoration sites with higher fire frequency moved more rapidly towards the reference conditions than sites with fewer fires. By quantifying the ""moving target"" of reference ecosystems while simultaneously measuring change of restoration sites, this application of the dynamic reference concept offers promise to manage for reference conditions that are achievable in a world where change is the norm. © 2012 by the Board of Regents of the University of Wisconsin System.","Disturbance; Dynamic Reference Concept; Longleaf pine; No-analog future; Reference conditions; Restoration",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84858649326

Using a model-selection framework, we found that the most supported models included terms for a quadratic effect of date and habitat type for the Hairy Woodpecker, a negative effect of percent shrub cover for the White-headed Woodpecker, and a negative linear effect of date and habitat type, a negative linear effect of snag density, and a positive linear effect of tree density for the flicker. Survival rates over the entire cycle (laying + incubation + nestling stages) were 0.51 in unburned stands and 0.41 in burned stands for the Hairy Woodpecker, 0.70 for the White-headed Woodpecker, and 0.41 in unburned stands and 0.80 in burned stands for the flicker.

Previous data and publications from the Stoddard Fire Plots supported a saturation model of fire frequency effects. According to this model, vascular plant species richness increases along with fire frequency but only up to a threshold determined by woody overstory competition. Beyond the threshold, further increases in fire frequency have little additional impact on species richness or understory vegetation composition. Prior analyses suggested this threshold to occur at ∼6-7. year burn intervals. In this paper we present more recent data from this same long term study that are not consistent with the "" Saturation Hypothesis"" as originally formulated. These results indicate (1) "" saturation"" of canopy (>2.0. m) cover at 3. year burn intervals rather than the predicted 6-7. years, (2) small-scale (≤1.0. m) species richness positively associated with fire frequency across a gradient of short-interval fires from 3- to 1-year, (3) statistically significant species composition (cover and abundance) shifts across this same short-interval fire frequency gradient, with greatest herbaceous dominance associated with 1- and 2-year burn treatments.

By ‘microhabitats’ we mean discrete parts of a tree that host different species assemblages. Some of the microhabitats are only present in living trees, typically in mature or old individuals (Figure 7.1), and additional ones become available after the trees die. Wounds, rot holes and cavities; attached dead branches and roots; phloem (inner bark), sapwood and heartwood; fruiting bodies and mycelia of decomposer fungi etc. each host very different species assemblages. In this chapter, we describe in more detail the various dead-wood microhabitats, and the many ways in which saproxylic species can be dependent on their particular microenvironments. We present the microhabitats in the order in which they appear in a tree, starting from wounds and sap exudations that can occur even in young trees, followed by cavities and other microhabitats that develop as a result of decay in mature living trees, and ending with those microhabitats, such as subcortical space, that become available only after a tree has died. Some microhabitats, especially sap exudations and cavities, are far more common in broadleaved than in coniferous trees. Wounds and sap exudations in living trees Many factors can cause injuries to trees. Mechanical damage includes branch and stem breakages by wind, wounds made by falling trees hitting adjacent trees, lightning strikes, fire scars, frost cracks and snow breakage. Pathogenic fungi and bacteria can create necrotic patches, termed cankers, in the phloem layer. Most of the fungi that induce cankers kill the phloem and do not bring about sap flows. ‘Bleeding cankers’ are generally caused either by bacteria (Schmidt et al., 2008) or by Phytophthora species (Oomycetes) (Brown and Brasier, 2007) and produce only small amounts of exudates. Some vertebrate species, such as woodpeckers, and many invertebrate species can injure the bark, which may result in sap exudation and provide an opportunity for microbial colonization. For instance, cicadas (Hemiptera: Cicadidae) are known to cause sap exudation by piercing the bark with their stylet-like mouthparts to feed on sap (Yamazaki, 2007), and carpenterworm (Lepidoptera: Cossidae) larvae can initiate and maintain sap exudation by gnawing the bark (Yoshimoto and Nishida, 2007). © J.

Bark also contributes to fuel load in wildfires and hazard reduction burning, with a concomitant loss of habitat and modification of habitat resources. We compared the composition and abundance of tree trunk invertebrates inhabiting four eucalypt bark types and determined the impact of burning the bark on population abundance and community composition. Trees of four bark types (gum, box, stringybark, ironbark) were selected at three sites and arthropod traps placed on burnt and unburnt trees of each type. Traps were left in place for 12 days and arthropod preferences for the four bark types (burnt and unburnt) were analysed. The total number of arthropods differed between bark types, with stringybark and ironbark supporting the largest numbers of invertebrates and the most diverse communities. Burnt stringybark and gum bark had reduced arthropod abundance compared to unburnt bark.

A pioneer therophyte species of forest zones, it occurs in large numbers when associated with major disturbances such as forest fires, but is also common in areas of smaller scale disturbance such as shores, forest edges and wind-throws. Soil conditions may vary greatly in nutrient content, moisture content, pH and salinity. In Canada, it is generally considered a minor garden and agricultural weed. It is most common in crops such as lowbush blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon), strawberry (Fragaria_ananassa) and vegetable crops; however, it occasionally occurs in other field and forage crops. Impacts include a variety of problems contributing to increased production costs or crop yield losses, including herbicide resistance, resource competition, and as a reservoir harbouring crop pathogens. It has been valued as a medicinal herb for treating a variety of ailments.

We examine the paradigms under which rangeland management operates and argue that our profession developed under the utilitarian paradigm with the primary goals of sustainable forage for livestock production. While optimization of multiple rangeland products and services has always been a consideration, a comprehensive set of principles have not be been developed to advance this concept. We argue that fire and grazing, often viewed as mere tools used for production goals, should rather be viewed as essential ecosystem processes. Rangeland management continues to operate under the utilitarian paradigm appropriate to societal values of the 20th century and by and large has failed to provide management guidance to reverse degradation of several highly valued ecosystem services. We support this argument with evidence that biodiversity has declined on rangelands in the past half century and that much of this decline is due to management goals that favor a narrow suite of species. The full suite of ecosystem services valued by society will only benefit by management for heterogeneity, which implies that there is no one goal for management and that landscape-level planning is crucial. Explicitly incorporating heterogeneity into state-and-transition models is an important advancement not yet achieved by our profession. We present new principles for rangeland management formed on the basis of conservation of pattern and process. While recognizing that many rangelands have significant deviations from historic plant communities and disturbance regimes, we suggest that management for conservation of pattern and process should focus on fire and grazing to the extent possible to promote a shifting mosaic across large landscapes that include patches that are highly variable in the amount of disturbance rather than the current goal of uniform moderate disturbance.","biodiversity; fire; grazing; landscape ecology; pyric herbivory; shifting mosaic",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870200207

However, in some ecosystems there is little information about bird species' responses to these fire programs. In 2004 we measured habitat characteristics and conducted point counts in 12 burned sites and four unburned sites in the Chattahoochee National Forest of northern Georgia. Burns were categorized by severity (low, medium, or high) and time since fire (1-2 or 3-6. years). The basal area of snags, shrub stem density and percent canopy cover were similar among all treatments except high severity. Otherwise, fire severity had limited impacts on measured habitat characteristics. Following fires the densities of early-succession species such as eastern towhee (Pipilo erythropthalmus) and indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea) were greatest in areas of higher fire severity. A ground-nesting species (ovenbird [. Seiurus aurocapilla]) was less abundant in burned sites and the density of a shrub nesting species, the hooded warbler (Setophaga citrine) was greatest in areas that received low severity fires. Scarlet tanager (Piranga olivacea), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), red-eyed vireo (Vireo olivaceus), black-throated green warbler (Setophaga virens), and black-and-white warbler (Mniotilta varia) had similar densities among all burn severities and showed no relationships with time since fire. Low and medium severity fires provided few benefits for most bird species. When conditions allow for their application, severe fires may be considered as a useful and historically appropriate management tool for some high-priority bird species in the southern Appalachian Mountains. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Bird communities; Early-succession; Fire effects; Southern Appalachians",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054681622

We investigated food hoarding behaviour of buff-breasted rat (Rattus flavipectus) under conditions of semi-natural enclosures in the tropical rain-forest of the Xishuangbanna area (altitude 475-2430 m, 21°09′-22°36′N, 99°58′-101°50′E), Yunnan Province, Southwest China. The main goal of this study was to understand the influence of intra- and inter-specific competition on food hoarding behaviour of rodents. Seeds of Lithocarpus truncatus (Fagaceae), with woody and hard seed coat, were selected and marked as a food item in this experiment. The result showed that: (1) R. flavipectus mainly exhibited food hoarding behaviour in larder form; and (2) the presence of intra-specific competitors significantly increased larder hoarding in R. flavipectus, while an inter-specific competitor, Chinese white-bellied rat (Niviventor confucianus), exerted no significant influence on food hoarding behaviour of subjects. These results indicated that rodent species would adjust their food hoarding behaviour in the presence of competitors, and intra-specific competition has a greater effect than inter-specific competition. © 2012 Copyright 2011 Dipartimento di Biologia Evoluzionistica dell'Università, Firenze, Italia.","intra- and inter-specific competition; Lithocarpus truncatus; Rattus flavipectus; seed hoarding; Xishuangbanna",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863131230

That is, they were purposely juxtaposed. It is obvious that two or more of these interacting motifs are used as a symbolic ""shorthand"" within the rock-art to imply a greater meaning than just the parts portrayed. The most notable examples (as previously discussed) are the two groupings at Maddin Creek (the Twins and Giant in Fig. 4.7a and the petaloid sun circle and bilobed arrows in Fig. 4.10). Other examples include the mace and foot, bird and vulva form, foot and bilobed arrow, and bird and cross-in-circle. These repeated motif combinations unquestionably had symbolic significance during the Mississippian period and perhaps also earlier in the Woodland period. The bilobed arrow and mace, being two of the major attributes of the Hawk Being (or ""Birdman""), belong primarily to the Upper World realm of the cosmos. When these two motifs are combined with the ogee, they may signify a celestial journey, the eye and eye-in-hand being associated with the portal to another level of the cosmos or ""Path of Souls"" (Lankford 2004:212-213). The hafted celt is connected to warfare and the feet to the brave warrior (Hawk Being) deeds referenced in the ethnographies. Although the precise meaning or intent may be unknown, we can be fairly certain of the significance of the component parts repeated in the rock-art multiple times across a broad territory and can certainly fathom their probable meanings (as discussed earlier) from the available ethnographic literature. By analyzing the co-occurrences and variations found in the rock-art motifs, we can infer the meanings encoded in these symbols. It appears to be a mixing of Late Woodland, Middle Mississippian, and Oneota iconography in the Middle Mississippi Valley region. This does not come as a surprise, because this riparian landscape was surely marked by a trafficking of exotic goods, information, technologies, and oral traditions from many points north, south, east, and west over an extended period. In addition, I believe that the material under examination has its origins in early Dhegihan culture, on the basis of content. The Dhegihan Sioux language was spoken by the cognate tribes of the Osage, Omaha, Ponca, Kansa (Kaw), and Quapaw. The Osage and Quapaw/Arkansas were the first tribes of this major linguistic group known to be encountered in this region. At that time the Osage were in control of the better part of four contiguous states and were assuredly not newcomers to the region. They were most likely descendants of the proto- Dhegihan groups that constructed, thrived at, and eventually abandoned nearby Cahokia (Diaz-Granados 1993; Duncan and Diaz-Granados 2000; Diaz-Granados and Duncan 2004). There is a movement of secc symbols (e.g., Birdman/Hawk Being, Piasas/ Underwater Spirit, bilobed arrows, feet) from north to south and from east to west and west to east. The corpus of significant artifacts bearing the elite symbolism characteristic of the Cahokia subarea at the confluence seems to begin a southward migration just before ad 1200. We see a burst of rockart along the eastern Ozark highlands and a dramatic increase in secc/miis symbols. During this florescence and complexity in the rock-art, many of the adjacent mound sites were increasing in size. Sacred objects such as marine shell gorgets and copper plates in the Braden style appear in the grave goods at Mississippian centers south of Cahokia in the southeast quadrant of Missouri, the same area in which the bulk of the rock-art sites occur. Several sites west of Sikeston Ridge (e.g., the Powers site) show abandonment and burning, and the inhabitants exhibiting a Caddoan ceramic tradition also appear to have been pushed westward. In spite of the regional variation, the predominant motifs and their associated oral traditions have apparently persisted through centuries in their various forms. It stands to reason that motifs serving as mnemonic devices for oral traditions (which is the case in at least some rock-art panels) were handed down for numerous generations. The symbols delineate specific characters who appear in widespread oral traditions of epic proportion. This is evident in much of the ethnographic material from the Southeast, Midwest, and Eastern Plains. Several common themes appear to link the icons with the oral traditions in this great expanse, once again with regional variations, as would be expected. An example of the lasting importance and strength of this system is the western Mississippian or proto-Dhegihan peoples, who are on record as still using some of these symbols (such as the long-nose, mace, eye, woodpecker, hand, and serpent) well into the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. As the possible epicenter of this collection of narratives and its accompanying iconography and artifact assemblages, I would single out the region surrounding the confluence of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers, surely the most important prehistoric crossroads in North America. The concentration of rock-art, evidence of in situ ritual activity, and employment of powerful and/or sacred motifs support this assertion. According to Jeffrey Brain and Philip Phillips (1996:339), ""evidence of direct Etowah-Moundville contact is notably sparse."" While this may be true on the surface, this seeming disparity may be a matter of different industries, intent, or purpose - with Moundville's concentration on Lower World matters and Etowah's on the Upper World - and not necessarily evidence of lack of contact or intercourse. The relative abundance of secc motifs at Picture Cave (such as maces in conjunction with turbans and trailers, red sashes, falconid eye-markings, figures with occipital hair-knots, and a large single upright feather, all within an interval dating from ad 940 +/-80 to 1090 +/-90; see Diaz-Granados et al. 2001) is notable and connects this site on various levels with the outlying mound centers. In addition, it connects these secc/miis icons with the earliest known dates for these objects in the eastern United States. This information should be included in any search for the origins of the secc/miis, although two obvious motifs are absent at Picture Cave: the bilobed arrow and the cross-in-circle. This in itself has special meaning. This rock-art imagery is relatively new information that was unavailable to Waring and Holder, Howard, Brain and Phillips, and others. In addition, the congruency of the early five-date cluster for the Picture Cave panels strengthens the argument for a Middle Mississippi Valley genesis of the iconography and its associated ceremonialism. In conclusion, this body of secc/miis icons does not appear to be spatially static or confined to a particularly limited time frame; it was part of a strong but understandably evolving system of symbols used for message transfer and social and economic control by the ruling factions. This social and economic system was obviously expanding, along with accompanying rites and rituals needed to establish kinship and economic ties with neighboring groups (for example, see Duncan and Diaz-Granados 2000). Aside from regional stylistic variations within the iconography, many of these motifs that no doubt accompanied the oral traditions had great longevity. These symbols are repeated in numerous artifacts over a wide expanse and support the manifestation of a pantheon of characters with a rich and lasting set of oral traditions - major narratives. Several common themes link the icons with the oral traditions in this large interaction sphere (again with obvious regional variations, as reflected in the diversity of motifs and co-occurrences). Although the grouping of icons at rock-art sites may not be considered a ""writing system,"" it was unquestionably a shorthand system of communication for another time. It is our job to continue to recognize and identify the regional variations, determine how and why icons are grouped, and explore their connection to the ethnographic literature. © 2011 by The University of Texas Press.

Yet, even these appear to be losing their ability to support some of their stenotopic species such as the ladybird spider, Eresus kollari Rossi 1846, and are thus becoming increasingly important for the preservation of these species. The habitat requirements of this endangered spider species were investigated in order to obtain data that will help stabilize the last remnants of the species' population in northwest Germany. Several heathland habitats were surveyed by pitfall trapping during the mate-search period of the males. Two statistical methods were applied: logistic regression and boosted regression trees (BRT). Both methods showed that three habitat variables are of prime relevance in predicting the occurrence of E. kollari: a) thickness of the organic layer (a negative effect), b) soil temperature at a depth of 10 cm, and c) Calluna cover in the herb layer (both have positive effect). Our results show that choppering (removing above-ground biomass and most of O-layer) and burning are likely appropriate heathland management measures for the conservation of E. kollari. Such measures improve the species' habitat quality by creating a heterogenic (small-scaled) heathland structure with suitable microhabitats. As Calluna heathlands show a clear senescence of the dominant heather, it is essential that those habitat patches be conserved. Further measures, such as transfer experiments, are recommended. © 2011 The American Arachnological Society.","action plan; burning; choppering; Conservation management; habitat modeling",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83455263481

They play an important role in tree decomposition, often reducing the value of salvageable timber, and represent an important avian food source. 2 Three forest areas that experienced wildfires 1-3 years previously were surveyed during the summer of 2004. Ponderosa pine trees with green, scorched and consumed needles were examined for wood borer occurrence. Within each of the three needle damage categories, the mean wood borer incidence was similar between different age fires. Trees with scorched or consumed needles had significantly more wood borers than trees with green needles. 3 Larvae collected from under tree bark were identified to family; when possible, cerambycids were identified further to Acanthocinus spp., Monochamus sp., Rhagium inquisitor (L.) and Stictoleptura canadensis (LeConte), and buprestids were identified to Chalcophora spp. and Chrysobothris sp. 4 Classification tree models showed that the estimated probability of tree infestation by wood borers varied among needle damage categories. For trees with green needles, tree injury variables of high bole char height and phloem discolouration were important predictive variables. In trees where needles were consumed, tree size variables of diameter at breast height and tree height were important predictive variables. 5 More than half the dead trees examined were infested with wood borers, indicating that infestation of fire-killed ponderosa pine may represent an important food source for species such as woodpeckers and a potential problem for the utilization of infested trees.

Therefore, we examined effects of six treatments of increasing management intensity via combinations of MSP (strip-shear and wide spacing or roller chop and narrow spacing) and CSP (application or no application) treatments with banded or broadcast HWC on bird communities in six loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) plantations in the Coastal Plain of North Carolina, USA, for 8. years following site preparation. Wide pine spacing and strip-shear MSP increased bird abundance and species richness over narrow spacing and chopped MSP for 6. years after planting. Chemical SP reduced bird abundance in year 2, increased bird abundance in year 6, had no effect on abundance after year 7, and did not affect species richness in any year. Total bird abundance and species richness were similar between banded and broadcast HWC. Site preparation and HWC had no effect on bird diversity and bird communities were most similar in treatments of similar intensity. Site preparation and HWC had few or no effects on birds based upon migratory status, habitat association, or conservation value. The addition of chemical site preparation or HWC had little effect on birds beyond pine spacing, and bird abundance was not proportional to management intensity. Although we observed treatment effects, all treatments provided habitat used by a variety of bird species, and pine plantations may play an increasingly important role in bird conservation as forests become fragmented and converted to other land uses and as natural processes that create early successional habitat, such as fire, are suppressed. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Bird abundance; Forest management; Herbaceous weed control; Intensive forestry; North Carolina; Pinus taeda",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84860400101

Ground-based field surveying is a conventional method for mapping and characterizing downed logs but is limited. In addition, optical remote sensing methods have not been able to map these ground targets due to the lack of optical sensor penetrability into the forest canopy and limited sensor spectral and spatial resolutions. Lidar (light detection and ranging) sensors have become a more viable and common data source in forest science for detailed mapping of forest structure. This study evaluates the utility of discrete, multiple return airborne lidar-derived data for image object segmentation and classification of downed logs in a disturbed forested landscape and the efficiency of rule-based object-based image analysis (OBIA) and classification algorithms. Downed log objects were successfully delineated and classified from lidar derived metrics using an OBIA framework. 73% of digitized downed logs were completely or partially classified correctly. Over classification occurred in areas with large numbers of logs clustered in close proximity to one another and in areas with vegetation and tree canopy. The OBIA methods were found to be effective but inefficient in terms of automation and analyst's time in the delineation and classification of downed logs in the lidar data. © 2011 by the authors.","Downed dead wood; Downed logs; Lidar; Object-based image analysis (OBIA)",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856732722

These factors also can interact as individuals under predation pressure make trade-offs between access to food resources and exposure to predators. Fires consume food sources and reduce cover, which increases exposure to predators. For species that occur in areas with frequent fire, it is instructive to consider how all of these factors interact to affect populations of interest. We examined how supplemental feeding, mammalian predator exclusion, and prescribed fire affected survival, abundance, and reproduction of cotton mice (Peromyscus gossypinus) and oldfield mice (P. polionotus) in a longleaf pine ecosystem. Burning and predator exclusion interacted to affect survival of cotton mice; survival was similar in predator exclosures and controls in nonburning periods and in controls following prescribed burns but increased in exclosures following burns. Rates of transitions to reproductive states (which for females includes lactation or gravidity and for males, descent of testes) decreased in burn years but increased with the combination of feeding and predator exclusion. Supplemental feeding increased abundances. Among oldfield mice, survival and abundance were greater in predator exclusion areas than in controls. Supplemental feeding and the interaction of feeding and predator exclusion also increased abundances. During peak breeding seasons during which burning occurred rates of transitions to reproductive states declined to such an extent that reproductive transition rates in these seasons were lower than during nonpeak breeding seasons. © 2011 American Society of Mammalogists.","cotton mouse; food supplementation; oldfield mouse; Peromyscus gossypinus; Peromyscus polionotus; predation; prescribed fire",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-80054764416

Post-fire tree mortality, snag persistence, tree fall patterns and variables influencing snag dynamics were assessed in deciduous, mixed and coniferous stands that experienced low- and moderate-severity fires. Temporal patterns of tree mortality for the three species revealed that mortality was delayed through time. Most post-fire tree mortality occurred within 2 years following fire but continued until the end of the 10-year observation period. Jack pine was the most persistent snag species, followed by trembling aspen and black spruce. Factors influencing the persistence of snags were multi-scaled and generally species-specific. Fire severity was the only common factor influencing snag persistence among all species, with snags located in severely-burned stands being less susceptible to falling. Trembling aspen snag persistence increased with basal area and diameter. Salvage logging in the vicinity affected black spruce. Fall patterns also differed among species. Bypasses of the snag stage (i.e. when a living tree falls directly to the forest floor) as well as uprooting of snags were common. © 2011 IAWF.","black spruce; delayed tree mortality; fire severity; jack pine; Picea mariana (Mill.)

Using soil cores, the soil microarthropod groups Prostigmata, Oribatida, and Collembola were examined before and after a low-intensity prescribed fire intended for fuels reduction and wildlife habitat improvement. A post-burn evaluation found 100% duff layer coverage and 80% of the understory vegetation consumed. Prostigmata numbers were significantly reduced four months after the burn, with numbers returning to pre-burn levels more than one year later. Although Oribatida and Collembola fluctuated from year to year, we found no significant effects from the burn on those taxa. These results suggest that low-intensity prescribed burning has no lasting negative effects on soil microarthropod populations. The results from this study add to the evidence suggesting the adaptability of southeastern forests to low-intensity prescribed fire.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80053542121

We also evaluated the utility of the Keetch-Byram Drought Index (KBDI) as a predictor of post-burn stand and fuel conditions by comparing post-burn stand variables for different ranges of KBDI (23-78; more wet, and 328-368; more dry). We found that yellow pine seedlings were effectively absent in post-burn forests until overstory density was reduced over 40%, understory density was reduced over 80%, and post-burn shrub cover was 10% or less. We also observed that a reduction in total fuels of 60% and a post-burn duff layer depth of less than four cm were required for successful regeneration of yellow pine. Total herbaceous species cover exhibited near identical responses with increased cover following an 80% reduction in understory density and a post-burn duff depth of less than 4. cm. We observed strong positive relationships between high KBDI values and burn severity, changes in forest structure, reductions in fuels, and post-burn yellow pine reproduction. We observed continuous recruitment of yellow pine seedlings 5. years after fire in high KBDI burns while low KBDI burns showed little change in yellow pine density through time. An intense outbreak of the southern pine beetle (SPB; Dendroctonus frontalis) occurred within 2. years of our high KBDI burns and reduced shading resulting from overstory mortality likely enhanced the survival of yellow pine seedlings. The results of this study provide targets for the application of prescribed fire to restore yellow pine in the southern Appalachians. Continued research and monitoring will help determine how prescribed fire can best be applied in combination with other disturbance agents such as SPB to perpetuate yellow pine forests. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Disturbance regimes; Ecological restoration; Fire effects; Fuel reduction; Great Smoky Mountains National Park; Prescribed fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957900119

We used radiotelemetry data collected during 2003-2008 to estimate reproductive parameters in a declining northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) population in South Florida, and to test hypotheses regarding factors influencing these parameters. The overall clutch size was 12.10 ± 0.22, but females laid more eggs in their first clutch (12.43 ± 0.24) than in subsequent clutches (10.19 ± 0.53) within a nesting season. Daily nest survival was higher for first (0.966 ± 0.003) than subsequent nests (0.936 ± 0.011). Hatchability (proportion of laid eggs that hatched conditional upon nest survival to hatching) was 0.853 ± 0.008, but was higher for nests incubated by females (0.873 ± 0.009) than those incubated by males (0.798 ± 0.018). The proportion of individuals attempting a second nest was 0.112 ± 0.024 and 0.281 ± 0.040 when the first nest was successful and failed, respectively. Hatchability was lower when the nesting habitat was burned the previous winter. We found no evidence that food strip density (a management practice to provide supplemental food) influenced any of the reproductive parameters. Mean summer temperature affected hatchability, nest survival, and proportion of nests incubated by males. Overall, the reproductive output in our study population was lower than that reported for most other bobwhite populations, indicating that low reproductive performance may have contributed to bobwhite population declines in our study site. These results suggest that current management practices, particularly those related to habitat and harvest management, need careful evaluation. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.","Burning; Colinus virginianus; Hatchability; Male participation; Nest survival; Weather conditions",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960442272

Using an ecologically dominant small mammal population in experimentally burned habitat as a model, I empirically tested the effect of disturbance on survival, abundance and fecundity and investigated whether recently burned habitat is a population sink. I also examined the effect of fire on community diversity, particularly how fire influenced dominance by bushveld gerbils Tatera leucogaster (Peters 1852). Live trapping in the first year post-fire yielded a total of 4,774 captures of 1,076 individual bushveld gerbils in a tropical savanna in southern Africa. The robust design allowed for an investigation of the effects of fire, sex and temporal variation on survival while controlling for potential differences in detection and temporary emigration. Although there were fewer individuals in burned savanna during the first 6 months post-fire, their apparent monthly survival was not significantly lowered compared with the control, with males and females surviving equally well. Fecundity, represented by proportion of females lactating, was unaffected by fire and, overall, recently burned habitat does not appear to be sink habitat. The disturbance resistance exhibited by this species is likely a contributing factor to its ecological dominance in the area, which is subject to relatively frequent fires.

Here we present a model for estimating the transport of combustion gases into cylindrical, single-entrance cavities during exposures caused by different wildland fire scenarios. In these shelters, the entrance occurs near the top of the cavity. This empirical model was developed from a suite of numerical experiments using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Fire Dynamics Simulator, which spanned a range of entrance diameters, wind speeds, gas temperatures, and vertical angles of incidence. To evaluate the model's predictions, it was used to replicate, with great accuracy, a time series of carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in a controlled experiment where a fabricated cylindrical cavity was exposed to combustion products. The time constant for cavity filling is proportional to the ratio of cavity volume to entrance area. Hot gases lead to significant stratification within the cavity during exposures. To demonstrate the model's potential use in predicting faunal exposures in the context of land management, we show that the model can be used to estimate dosage within red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis Vieillot, 1809) cavities without requiring temporally detailed, local measurements of wind speed and combustion product concentrations.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051750038

Many red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) that reside on federal lands occur on 15 military installations in the southeastern United States. This close association has increased concern over potential conflicts between conservation requirements of endangered species and the military's mission of combat readiness. Our objectives were to 1) determine if military training operations affect behavior, reproductive success, and productivity of red-cockaded woodpeckers; 2) develop a frequency-weighting function to assess woodpecker hearing sensitivity; 3) identify factors that affect woodpecker responses to military training operations; 4) develop distance and dose-response thresholds for quantifying woodpecker responses to noise levels and stimulus distances; 5) characterize military training operations through quantification of sound levels, source identification, distance fromactive woodpecker nests, frequency spectra, duration, and frequency of occurrence; and 6) document baseline woodpecker nesting behavior. We conducted our study on the Fort Stewart Military Installation located in southeast Georgia, USA. Downy woodpeckers, as surrogates for red-cockaded woodpeckers, had their best hearing sensitivity within the peak range of the power spectrum of both downy and red-cockaded woodpecker vocalizations, which is at a higher frequency than that of a typical passerine. Overall, woodpeckers had a reduced auditory sensitivity relative to human hearing sensitivity and other species of small birds, especially in the frequency range >4 κHz.Woodpeckers were most sensitive in the 1.5- to 4.0-κHz range. Sensitivity appeared to drop off quickly at frequencies ^lt;1.0 κHz and >4.0 κHz. Overall, we did not find that the woodpecker-frequency-weighting function we developed provided a better predictor of woodpecker flush response compared with A-weighting. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between frequency-weighting functions and woodpecker response behavior. Potential breeding groups of woodpeckers across the population increased from 158 in 1997 to 181 in 2000, wheras nesting groups increased from 141 in 1998 to 170 in 2000, for overall increases of 14.6% and 20.6%, respectively, over the 3 years of this project. Fledging success rates for individual nests within the overall population remained consistent from 1998 to 2000, averaging 84.4%.Mean clutch sizes for woodpecker groups for 1998 to 2000 ranged from 2.75 to 3.01 eggs/nest, brood size ranged from 2.01 to 2.22 nestlings/nest, whereas the average number of young fledged ranged from 1.57 to 1.76 young/ occupied nest. We observed no difference in reproductive success or productivity between experimental and control-tested red-cockaded woodpecker groups. Overall, experimental test groups produced an average of 2.98 eggs/nest, 1.89 nestlings/nest, and 1.54 young/occupied nest from 1999 to 2000, compared with 2.73 eggs/nest, 1.91 nestlings/nest, and 1.57 young/occupied nest at control groups. We measured behavioral responses (nest attendance and arrivals and departures from the nest) of red-cockaded woodpeckers to military training events through direct and indirect (i.e., video surveillance) observation of 464.5 hours of woodpecker nesting behavior before and after controlled experimental events while recording and characterizing military-generated sound events using sound-recording equipment.We presented woodpeckers with actual 0.50- caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators from controlled distances to develop distance and sound thresholds.We used video surveillance to document potential behavioral responses of woodpeckers primarily during nonexperimental military training operations in areas that could not be safely monitored and to determine baseline woodpecker nesting behaviors. We recorded 2,846 nonexperimental military noise events in 157 data sessions at 50 red-cockaded woodpecker groups from 1998 to 2000. We also recorded 206 experimental tests at 58 woodpecker groups during 1999 and 2000. Life-table analyses of flush response time showed that at short ranges (15-30 m) the flush response was stronger for artillery simulator blasts than for blank fire in both the incubation and the nestling phases. In contrast, at medium distances (45-60 m) blank fire tended to produce more flush responses than artillery fire in both incubation and nestling phases. At longer distances (>60 m), blank fire and artillery produced similar flush responses in the incubation phase, whereas flush response was stronger for blank fire than for artillery in the nestling phase. In general, most animals that responded to military activity flushed within 5 seconds of the stimulus event. Woodpeckers returned to nests within an average of 4.4 minutes after being flushed by artillery simulators and 6.3 minutes after 0.50-caliber blank-fire tests. Woodpecker flush response rates increased as stimulus distance decreased and sound levels increased, regardless of stimulus type or year.Woodpeckers did not flush from nests when 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators were >152 m away and sound-exposure levels (decibels [dB]) were <68 dBW (woodpecker-based frequency-weighting curve) and <65 dBW, respectively. We found that blast treatments reduced arrival rates of adults at the nest, with the amount of reduction dependent on the type of blast stimulus and number of helpers at the nest. On the other hand, blast treatments had no detectable effects on nest attendance. The effect of blank fire on incubationphase arrivals over a 30-minute interval (about 40% reduction) was nearly twice that of artillery simulator fire (about a 20% reduction). There was no evidence supporting any effect of stimulus type on arrivals during the nestling phase. Blast stimuli during incubation reduced arrivals by 40% when no helpers were present, but the strength of this effect decreased to 28% when one helper was present, and was only 6% for nests with ≤2 helpers. Distance of the blast from the nest did not affect the response of arrival rates to blast treatments. Infrequent, short-duration military training exercises, as measured, did not appear to substantially impact red-cockaded woodpecker reproductive success and productivity on the Fort Stewart Military Installation. Our results may be applicable to other military installations where similar training activities and intensity levels occur. Additional research is needed to address possible habituation or sensitization of red-cockaded woodpeckers to human activities in proximity to active nest sites. Although we attempted to monitor woodpecker response to a number of military training activities, other types of military training operations or human-based activities with louder noise, longer duration, increased human presence, and greater frequency of occurrence could more negatively influence woodpecker nesting behavior and need to be investigated. Our results do not support the hypothesis that military maneuver training operations are limiting factors in the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers on military installations, based on our level and type of testing. Natural resource management policies on military installations have had a positive influence on the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers and probably outweigh the negative effects of typical military training. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","Behavioral response; flush; Fort Stewart; Georgia; military training; noise disturbance; Picoides borealis; red-cockaded woodpecker; sound recording; video surveillance; woodpecker weighting curve",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79960182727

Redpoll and Tree Pipit were more common within than outside the burns. Birds feeding on insects in the air and the Redstart were more abundant in burned than in unburned spruce-dominated forest but no such difference was found in pine-dominated forest, suggesting that the short-term effects of wildfire on these birds were stronger in spruce-dominated forest than in pine-dominated forest.

We examined effects of low-severity prescribed fires on counts of birds in a managed forest in the Sierra Nevada of California immediately, 1 year, and 3-6 years after fire was applied in spring. Of 26 species analyzed, counts of 3 species increased after fire (Pacific-slope flycatcher [Empidonax difficilis], brown creeper [Certhia americana], and American robin [Turdus migratorius]), and 6 species decreased after fire (Anna's hummingbird [Calypte anna], Hutton's vireo [Vireo huttoni], warbling vireo [Vireo gilvus], golden-crowned kinglet [Regulus satrapa], Nashville warbler [Vermivora ruficapilla], hermit warbler [Dendroica occidentalis]). Black-throated gray warbler (Dendroica nigrescens) increased in the first year following fire but decreased 3-6 years after fire. When grouped into guilds, habitat association and foraging guild best explained responses to fire, with the greatest changes occurring for oak-associated species (negative), riparian-associated species (positive), aerial foragers (positive), and bark foragers (positive). Lastly, when we compared our counts to those collected during the 1910s, changes were consistent with those predicted from fire suppression and species' affinity for burned forests, suggesting that results from contemporary fire studies should be interpreted within an ecological context that includes effects of fire suppression. We found that low-severity prescribed fires applied in spring served to drive the bird community towards pre-suppression conditions. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","avian ecology; birds; fire suppression; forest; Joseph Grinnell; prescribed fire; Sierra Nevada",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959766502

These same forces also appear important in driving smaller-scale variation in the structure and composition of slash-pine forests. Important gaps remain, however, in our understanding of how plants and animals in slash-pine ecosystems respond to variation in fire and hydrological regimes. We addressed this issue for one taxon - landbirds - by estimating density at 285 locations in southwest Florida that differed in fire history and water-table elevation. Bird densities during the breeding season and during the winter did not vary appreciably as a function of either fire history or water-table elevation, and neither did vegetation structure at our survey locations. Birds and plants in this fire-climax forest are both resilient and resistant to changes brought about by frequent, low-intensity fire, and we suspect that significant effects of variation in fire history are only observable under extreme conditions (e.g., complete fire suppression) outside of the range of variation that we sampled. Water-table elevation had a stronger, albeit still small, effect on bird densities and vegetation structure, but the effects were difficult to generalize. Sampling across a broader range of hydrological conditions may yield valuable insight into the structure of pineland bird assemblages, especially given the likelihood that ecosystem restoration efforts in south Florida will produce substantial changes in water-table elevation.","Florida; hydrology; landbirds; pine flatwoods; pine rocklands; prescribed fire; slash pine",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051764080

The treatments consisted of transitional season fire with four different return intervals: 1-yr, 2-yr, 3-yr fire return intervals, and fire suppressed plots. The remaining secondary plots were treated using a 2-yr late dormant season fire cycle. The old growth plots were treated using a 2-yr growing season fire cycle.

We recorded the occupancy rate, clutch and brood size, hatching, fledging and nesting success in nest boxes placed on study plots with different post-fire age. By examining the post-fire succession, we analysed the survival of eggs and nestlings under predation risks. As the forest matured after a wildfire, tits occupied more nest boxes and laid more eggs that suffered less predation than in earlier successional stages. Although the incubation fate improved at each step of succession, the conditions to fully raise nestlings seemed to be suitable only in the oldest woods. Our findings indicate that the population dynamics of a reputed generalist avian species may be affected by fire.

Prescribed burning and roller chopping are management practices widely used in pine flatwoods to control shrubs and increase the growth of herbaceous vegetation. However, the impacts these treatments have on this system and its associated avian communities are largely unknown. We examined the effects of prescribed burning and roller chopping on pine flatwoods avian communities using a paired sample approach. Avian communities were compared between treated (e.g., burned) and untreated areas. We considered abundance and richness of all birds, but also groups of conservation concern, and those likely impacted by seasonal management practices (e.g., breeding and non-breeding categories, and woodland, successional-scrub, and grassland guilds). Dormant season burning resulted in decreases in avian species richness and abundance within the non-breeding, overwintering community. In situations where the maintenance or enhancement of this avian group is desired, growing season burning appears beneficial and should be used in preference to dormant season burning. Growing season burning benefited breeding avian communities, resulting in increases in species richness and abundance within this group. Dormant season roller chopping had no effect on species richness or abundance of any avian category or guild. Increases in abundance within breeding avian communities were observed following growing season roller chopping and a roller chopping/burning combination. Grazing, did not mediate the effects of prescribed burning or roller chopping on avian species richness or abundance. The use of dormant season burning is likely inappropriate in situations where conservation and management of non-breeding, overwintering species is a priority. The use of growing season roller chopping appears to provide a potential treatment alternative in situations where positive effects on breeding species are desired. Overall, maintenance of avian abundance and richness may be best achieved through the diverse application of prescribed burning and roller chopping based on season, frequency, and space. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Abundance; Avian; Burning; Grazing; Roller chopping; Species richness",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79955028604

High nesting densities in this study may have resulted from: (1) optimal timing of the fire for wood-boring beetle exploitation of burned trees, (2) the discrete nature of burned habitat in the study due to impacts of salvage logging, or (3) our focus on regions of the burn where high nesting densities occurred, as the entire burned area (404 ha) was not included in nest density calculations. © 2011 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957512845

We built up two long-term (> 200 years) chronosequences following time since the last fire in the unmanaged boreal forest of northeastern Québec, one in the balsam fir-white birch domain (southern region) and one in the spruce-mosses domain (northern region). We then sampled and characterized snags and live trees in 30 stands from each of these two chronosequences. We also looked for nest cavities on all sampled snags, performed bird inventories by point counts, and calculated tree mortality rate from permanent sample plots. Results show that mortality rates follow a U-shaped pattern, with more snags of large diameter (> 20 cm DBH) in young (< 50 years) and in old (> 200 years) forests. In the latter, we also found more nest cavities than in any other age classes. Although abundance of primary cavity nesters (excavating species) did not vary among age classes, secondary cavity nesters (using cavities already available) tend to be more numerous in older forests. Our results highlight the capacity for young and old-growth forests to provide quality habitat for species that are dependent on large snags. Proper forest management should maintain a mosaic of different age forest stands, including snags, to promote biodiversity and provide important resources for resident bird species.","Basal area; Boreal forests; Cavity nesting birds; Long term chronosequence; Mortality rate; Old-growth; Snags; Time since fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957556115

As such, evaluation of postfire management practices on nest survival rates of cavity nesters is necessary for determining conservation strategies. We monitored 1,797 nests of 6 cavity-nesting bird species: Lewis's woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), black-backed woodpecker (P. arcticus), northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), and mountain bluebird (S. currucoides) from 1994 to 2004 in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), mixed-severity burned forests (partially logged and unlogged) of Idaho, USA. Based on a priori hypotheses, we modeled daily survival rate (DSR) of nests as a function of abiotic (temperature, precipitation), temporal (time since fire, calendar year) and biotic factors (distance to unburned forest, nest height, and tree harvest [partial-salvage logging vs. unlogged]). Multiple abiotic and biotic factors, other than direct effects of salvage logging, affected daily survival rates of breeding cavity-nesting birds. Hairy woodpecker was the only species in which partial-salvage logging had a measurable, negative impact on DSR. Managers implementing carefully planned salvage logging prescriptions that include both unlogged reserves and partially logged areas can expect to maintain habitat for successfully breeding cavity-nesting birds of the interior northwestern United States. Our results also suggest that nest survival for some species of cavity-nesting birds could be improved if unlogged reserves are located centrally in postfire forests, distant from unburned habitats that potentially serve as sources of nest predators. © 2011 The Wildlife Society.","Cavity-nesting birds; Colaptes auratus; Melanerpes lewis; Nest survival; Picoides spp.; Pinus ponderosa; Salvage logging; Sialia spp.; Wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79957605801

The period after fledging is the time when chicks learn to fly, forage, and hide from predators. We monitored postfledging survival, causespecific mortality, and movements of Grasshopper Sparrows (Ammodramus savannarum) in grassland managed with fire and grazing. In 2009, we attached radio transmitters to 50 nestlings from 50 different broods and modeled their survival in response to climatic, biological, and ecological variables. There was no effect of treatment on survival. The factor most influencing postfledging survival was age; no other variable was significant. The majority of chicks (74%) died within 3 days of radio-transmitter attachment. We attributed most mortality to mesopredators (48%) and exposure (28%). Fledglings' movements increased rapidly for the first 4 days after they left the nest and were relatively stable for the remaining 10 days we tracked them. On average, fledglings took flight for the first time 4 days after fledging and flew -10 m 9 days after fledging. Our data show that the Grasshopper Sparrow's survival rates may be less than most models relying on nest-success estimates predict, and we emphasize the importance of incorporating estimates of survival during the postfledging period in demographic models. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2011.","Ammodramus savannarum; Grasshopper Sparrow; Patch-burn grazing; Postfledging survival; Prescribed fire; Tallgrass prairie",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959360243

Yet, post-fire conditions may vary greatly within and among burns and thereby may affect habitat suitability for these species. We studied habitat selection of nesting black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus Swainson) in recently burned spruce-dominated boreal forests. Our objectives were to (i) identify factors involved in snag selection for both nesting and foraging and (ii) examine selection of nest sites within the burned landscape. A total of 92 nests and 1612 foraging observations were used to investigate snag selection. Our results show that both pre-fire forest conditions and fire severity are important in determining the quality of burned forests for black-backed woodpeckers. This species selected large snags for both nesting (>20 cm DBH) and foraging (>15 cm DBH). Woodpeckers selected deciduous and degraded ""pre-fire"" snags for nesting whereas black spruce snags that had been created by fire and that were moderately burned were preferred for foraging. Nest sites were concentrated in burned mature stands and supported higher densities of large snags (e.g., >15 cm DBH). Our results suggest that burned forest patches of at least 20 ha and composed mainly of burned mature and old-growth forests should be maintained during post-fire harvesting.

The present study examines species trait-habitat (using Fourth-corner and RLQ analyses) and habitat occupancy patterns (logistic regression models) of bird assemblages in boreal forest stands following disturbances by forest fire and salvage logging. The stands differed in the amount and composition of residual tree retention, salvage- and aquatic-edges, degree of burn severity (all measured at 100 and 500. m buffers), as well as landscape-level variables such as distance to previously burned forests. Tests of trait-habitat relationships showed that canopy-nesters and bark- and foliage- insectivores required high levels of residual trees of low burn severity, with the feeding guilds showing affinity for different stand composition. In contrast, ground-nesters and omnivores thrived in salvaged areas and associated edges. In addition, cavity-nesting and ground-foragers were associated with severely burned stands. The species' habitat occupancy patterns were commensurate with trait requirements, which also appeared to be scale-dependent. For example, some fire-associated species had high occupancy probability in severely burned stands at small-scale (100. m buffer), which was consistent with their cavity-nesting trait. This pattern, however, was not evident at large-scale, where their feeding requirement (bark-insectivores) for low-severity burns dominated. Our study suggests that trait-habitat relationships can provide critical information to the complex ways species' relate to key habitat factors following natural and anthropogenic disturbances. © 2011.","Bird communities; Boreal forest; Disturbance; Fourth-corner analysis; Post-fire salvaging; RLQ; Trait-habitat links",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79953747939

To improve our knowledge on these mechanisms, we examine cavity abundance, cavity occupation and reproductive performance of SCN in Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests subjected to two management systems: (i) dense ""young forests"" , maintained at such stage by clear-cuttings and burns, and (ii) ""old forest"" , subjected to extensive traditional grazing and scarce firewood extraction by selective cutting. Young forests had considerably lower density of cavities (1.29±0.71 vs 15.09±2.00 cavities ha-1), SCN species (0.18±0.11 vs 0.61±0.07 species ha-1) and nests (0.40±0.27 vs 2.67±0.25 nests of all SCN ha-1) than old forests, indicating that a low availability of cavities may limit SCN assemblages in young oak forests. However, reproductive parameters of great (Parus major) and blue (Cyanistes caeruleus) tits associated with the availability of food (laying date, clutch size, nestling number and weight, adult weight) did not differ between both forest types, suggesting that food supply was not reduced in young forests, at least for tits during the breeding season. Large diameter (up to 170cm dbh) decayed trees were the most likely to hold cavities, but birds preferred smaller living cavity-trees for nesting (90% of nests in 21-65cm dbh trees). The preservation of cavity-trees within traditionally managed old oak forests is crucial in providing nesting opportunities to SCN. Besides, the protection of these traditionally managed forests would also benefit to other forest organisms that depend on old and open oak forests. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Cavity occupation; Cavity-nesting birds; Dehesa; Quercus pyrenaica; Reproductive performance; Traditional management",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952039476

A major question is the degree to which mixed-severity fire regimes are simply an ecological intermediate between low- and high-severity fire regimes, versus a unique disturbance regime with distinct properties. The Klamath-Siskiyou Mountains of southwestern Oregon and northwestern California provide an excellent laboratory for studies of mixedseverity fire effects, as structurally diverse vegetation types in the region foster, and partly arise from, fires of variable severity. In addition, many mixed-severity fires have occurred in the region in the last several decades, including the nationally significant 200,000-ha Biscuit Fire. Since 2002, we have engaged in studies of early ecosystem response to 15 of these fires, ranging from determinants of fire effects to responses of vegetation, wildlife, and biogeochemistry. We present here some of our important early findings regarding mixed-severity fire, thereby updating the state of the science on mixed-severity fire regimes and highlighting questions and hypotheses to be tested in future studies on mixed-severity fire regimes. Our studies in the Klamath-Siskiyou Ecoregion suggest that forests with mixed-severity fire regimes are characterized primarily by their intimately mixed patches of vegetation of varied age, resulting from complex variations in both fire frequency and severity and species responses to this variation. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that the proximity of living and dead forest after mixed-severity fire, and the close mingling of early- and late-seral communities, results in unique vegetation and wildlife responses compared to predominantly low- or high-severity fires. These factors also appear to contribute to high resilience of plant and wildlife species to mixed-severity fire in the Klamath-Siskiyou Ecoregion. More informed management of ecosystems with mixed-severity regimes requires understanding of their wide variability in space and time, and the particular ecological responses that this variability elicits. © 2011 Halofsky et al.","Biscuit Fire; Ecosystem response to fire; Fire behavior; Fire mosaic; Fire regime; Fire severity; Klamath- Siskiyou Ecoregion; Post-fire ecology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83755180996

We implemented a Bayesian hierarchical model to: 1) estimate Black-backed Woodpecker occupancy probability in fire areas burned within a time window of 1-10 years; 2) identify relationships between occupancy probability and habitat covariates (fire age, change in canopy cover pre-to-post fire, and snag basal area), elevation, and latitude; and 3) estimate detection probability and relate it to survey interval length and survey type (passive v. broadcast). We included random fire-area effects in our model of occupancy probability to accommodate clusters of nonindependent points surveyed within the larger set of fire areas. Mean occupancy probability was estimated to be 0.097. Elevation (after controlling for latitude) had the strongest effect on occupancy probability (higher occupancy at higher elevation) followed by latitude (higher occupancy at northerly sites). Fire age was also important; occupancy probability was about 43higher on the youngest compared to oldest fires. Although the direction of regression coefficients were in the expected direction (positive), snag basal area and canopy cover change were of minor importance in affecting occupancy probability. There was some indication, however, that the importance of snag basal area increased with fire age. Weak links between occupancy and canopy cover change suggested the species uses a range of burn severities, and such heterogeneity may promote habitat longevity. Our estimate of overall detection probability (across all survey intervals) was 0.772. We found strong effects of survey interval length (higher for longer interval) and, especially survey type (higher for broadcast survey) on detection probability. Our modeling framework and implementation illustrates the flexibility of the Bayesian hierarchical approach for handling complexities such as estimating derived parameters (and variances) and modeling random effects, and should prove generally useful for occupancy studies. © 2011 Saracco et al.","Black-backed Woodpecker; Call-broadcast survey; Detectability; Fire ecology; Hierarchical model; Management indicator species; Occupancy model; Picoides arcticus; Removal model; Sierra Nevada",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862901565

Large Macrotermes (Isoptera) termite mounds in miombo woodlands form nutrient rich islands that sustain a different suite of woody plant species relative to the woodland matrix. We investigated the role of termitaria in providing habitat for cavity-using birds in miombo woodlands that had been greatly impacted by elephants and fire, by comparing the availability of habitat favored by cavity-using birds (tall trees, trees with deadwood, and cavities) on and off mounds, and then testing its effect on species richness and abundance of cavity-using birds. We surveyed 48 termitaria paired with 48 woodland matrix sites in the breeding season; and 54 matrix-termitarium pairs in the non-breeding season in Chizarira National Park, Zimbabwe. Generalized linear mixed-effects models showed that termitaria harboured significantly higher densities (ha-1) of habitat components considered important for cavity nesting birds. Density of trees &gt;6 m in height and incidence of trees with deadwood was nearly 10 times greater on mounds than in the matrix, and the density of cavities was nine times higher on mounds compared to the matrix. A model selection procedure showed that termitaria provided refugia for cavity-using birds and contributed to the resilience of bird communities through high on-mound densities of trees with deadwood. Large termitaria thus appear to play an important role in maintaining functionally important components of the avifauna in heavily impacted Miombo woodlands. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Biodiversity of cavity-using birds; Ecosystem engineer; Landscape heterogeneity; Macrotermes; Resilience",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951812292

We measured temporal and spatial variations in areas affected by severe fires and clearcutting throughout the 20th century in a 57, 332km 2 section of the eastern Canadian boreal forest. We examined the effects of these disturbances on spatio-temporal variations in the abundance of forests &gt;60 years. Natural variability for the abundance of forests &gt;60 years was estimated from simulations of natural disturbance regimes. We also measured compositional and structural differences between three categories of stands originating from relatively recent disturbances (∼50 years; clearcutting, fires, and clearcutting followed by fires), and one category of stands that were undisturbed for at least 200 years. At the regional level, we observed that forests &gt;60 years gradually became scarcer throughout the 20th century due to a gradual expansion of harvested areas, an effect most pronounced in the southern part of the region, where mature and old forest abundance was clearly outside the range of natural variability at the end of the studied period. At the stand level, forest composition and structure differed between stand-origin categories: clearcutting-origin stands contained more balsam fir (Abies balsamea), fire-origin stands more black spruce (Picea mariana), and fire/clearcutting-origin stands more hardwoods (Betula papyrifera and Populus tremuloides). Overall, we estimate that strict forest management targets based on natural disturbance regimes will be difficult to achieve in eastern North-American boreal forests, most notably because contemporary disturbance rates, including both clearcutting and fire, have gradually become higher than the fire rates observed during the preindustrial period. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Boreal forests; Clearcutting; Forest composition; Natural disturbances; Natural range of variability",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78651454981

Modeling approaches are currently being used to understand and forecast potential management effects in changing insect disturbance trends. However, detailed forest composition data needed for these efforts is often lacking. We used partial least squares (PLS) regression to integrate different combinations of satellite sensor data including Landsat, Radarsat-1, and PALSAR, as well as pixel-wise forest structure information derived from SPOT-5 sensor data (Wolter et al., 2009), to determine the best combination of sensor data for estimating near species-level proportional forest composition (12 types: 10 species and 2 genera). Single-sensor and various multi-sensor PLS models showed distinct species-dependent sensitivities to relative basal area (BA), with Landsat variables showing greatest overall sensitivity. However, best results were achieved using a combination of data from all these sensors, with several C-band (Radarsat-1) and L-band (PALSAR) variables showing sensitivity to the composition and abundance of specific species. Pixel-level forest structure estimates derived from SPOT-5 data were generally more sensitive to conifer species abundance (especially white pine) than to hardwood species composition. Relative BA models accounted for 68% (jack pine) to 98% (maple spp.) of the variation in ground data with RMSE values between 2.46% and 5.65% relative BA, respectively. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to determine the effective lower limits of usefulness of species relative BA estimates which ranged from 5.94% (jack pine) to 39.41% (black ash). These estimates were then used to produce a dominant forest species map for the study region with an overall accuracy of 78%. Most notably, this approach facilitated discrimination of aspen from paper birch as well as spruce and fir from other conifer species which is crucial for the study of forest tent caterpillar and spruce budworm dynamics in the Upper Midwest. We also demonstrate that PLS regression is an effective data fusion strategy for mapping composition of heterogeneous forests using satellite sensor data. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.","Basal area; Data fusion; Forest composition; Forest structure; Great Lakes; Landsat; Minnesota; Multi-sensor; PALSAR; PLS regression; Radarsat; SAR; SPOT",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650941148

Although anecdotal information for this habitat is available for Lewis's Woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis), no study has previously examined the importance of aspen woodlands to this species' breeding biology. From 2002 to 2004, we monitored 76 Lewis's Woodpecker nests in aspen riparian woodlands of south-central Idaho to describe nest-site characteristics and estimate the nests' survival. We quantified the vegetation at nest sites and randomly selected other sites to determine habitat features important in the species' selection of a nest site. We then related these features, as well as several time-specific covariates, to nest survival. Lewis's Woodpecker selected nest trees that were larger in diameter than random trees and selected nest sites with more trees, fewer woody stems, and less bare ground than random sites. However, nest-site characteristics were not important determinants of nest survival. Rather, nest-initiation date and daily maximum temperature had the strongest influence on nest survival, which was higher for early nesters and increased with increasing daily maximum temperature. Nest survival (74%) and productivity (2.3 fledglings per successful nest) were comparable to values observed for Lewis's Woodpeckers in burned pine forests, suggesting that aspen riparian woodlands also serve as valuable breeding habitat for this species in the Intermountain West.

We compared the species richness and composition of deadwood-associated beetle assemblages among undisturbed, recently burned, logged, and salvage-logged, boreal, mixed-wood stands. Species richness was lowest in salvage-logged stands, largely due to a negative effect of harvesting on the occurrence of wood- and bark-boring species. In comparison with undisturbed stands, the combination of wildfire and logging in salvage-logged stands had a greater effect on species composition than either disturbance alone. Strong differences in species composition among stand treatments were linked to differences in quantity and quality (e.g., decay stage) of coarse woody debris. We found that the effects of wildfire and logging on deadwood-associated beetles were synergistic, such that the effects of postfire salvage logging could not be predicted reliably on the basis of data on either disturbance alone. Thus, increases in salvage logging of burned forests may have serious negative consequences for deadwood-associated beetles and their ecological functions in early postfire successional forests. © 2010 Society for Conservation Biology.","Biological diversity; Coarse woody debris; Coleoptera; Deadwood; Forest fire; Forest management; Saproxylic insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751667731

More than 2500 species were processed, dominated by macro-invertebrates, vascular flora and macrofungi. Few significant impacts were evident, and most species groups were resilient to the disturbances imposed. Regeneration stocking did not meet specified standards on two gap release and seven shelterwood grids subjected to silvicultural treatment in the period 1988–2002. Six treated grids had a retained basal area of more than 18 m2 ha−1, which obviated the need for further regeneration. More than 50 y may be needed for biological processes to reverse the increase in bulk density of soil caused during harvesting. Cryptogams (especially lichens) were the species group most sensitive to disturbance, although recovery of species richness was nearly complete 10 y after disturbance. For cryptogams and vascular flora, species recorded in only one grid (singletons) were more likely to occur on reference grids than on silviculturally treated grids. For all species groups studied, the imprint of harvesting 40 or more years earlier on species composition had become indistinguishable from that on grids never harvested. Soil nutrient status correlated with species richness for fungi on wood (negatively), light-trapped invertebrates (positively), birds (positively) and terrestrial vertebrates (frogs, reptiles and mammals, negatively). Silvicultural disturbance (timber harvesting and associated burning) correlated with species richness for fungi on wood (positively), terrestrial vertebrates (positively) and cryptogams (negatively). Time since the last (prescribed) fire did not correlate with any species group. Plant disease decreased species richness of light-trapped invertebrates by about 35%. Very few taxa were sufficiently widespread or sufficiently responsive to silvicultural disturbance to be of value as bio-indicators, demonstrating the superiority of biodiversity monitoring over bio-indicator monitoring.

Sequential randomness would prevent stalking predators synchronising their attacks with long inter-scan intervals. We analysed the presence of sequential randomness in the scanning behaviour of the greater rhea (Rhea americana), a large flightless bird that forages solitarily or in groups. We analysed sequences of behaviour of 40 wild rheas, foraging solitarily or in groups of 2 to 17 individuals, in two populations in eastern Argentina. We used parametric (auto and cross-correlations) and non-parametric (runs and Spearman rank correlation) tests to detect dependence among intervals. We detected the temporal dependence of inter-scan intervals in 30 of 40 behavioural series, but only 11 of 40 sequences showed consistent dependence when tested using parametric and non-parametric tests. The temporal dependence detected in some individual sequences would still be used by predators to synchronise their attacks with long inattentive periods of the prey. However, simple simulations showed that attack success would not be different from that of predators launching their attacks at the beginning of a randomly selected inattentive period of the prey. We propose that temporal dependence among the length of inattentive periods in greater rheas would be the result of simple mechanistic rules determined by the compromise between foraging and scanning behaviour, and it would be of little value to potential stalking predators. © 2011 Dipartimento di Biologia Evoluzionistica dell'Università, Firenze, Italia.","greater rhea; predation; Rhea americana; scanning pattern; sequential randomness",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78751510142

The accumulated fuels associated with historical fire exclusion can cause undesirably high tree mortality rates following prescribed fires and wildfires. This is especially true for sugar pine (Pinus lambertiana Douglas), which is already negatively affected by the introduced pathogen white pine blister rust (Cronartium ribicola J.C. Fisch. ex Rabenh). We tested the efficacy of raking away fuels around the base of sugar pine to reduce mortality following prescribed fire in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks, California, USA. This study was conducted in three prescribed fires and included 457 trees, half of which had the fuels around their bases raked away to mineral soil to 0.5 m away from the stem. Fire effects were assessed and tree mortality was recorded for three years after prescribed fires. Overall, raking had no detectable effect on mortality: raked trees averaged 30 % mortality compared to 36 % for unraked trees. There was a significant effect, however, between the interaction of raking and average pre-treatment forest floor fuel depth: the predicted probability of survival of a 50 cm dbh tree was 0.94 vs. 0.96 when average pre-treatment fuel depth was 0 cm for a raked and unraked tree, respectively. When average pre-treatment forest floor fuel depth was 30 cm, the predicted probability of survival for a raked 50 cm dbh tree was 0.60 compared to only 0.07 for an unraked tree. Raking did not affect mortality when fire intensity, measured as percent crown volume scorched, was very low (0 % scorch) or very high (>80 % scorch), but the raking treatment significantly increased the proportion of trees that survived by 9.6 % for trees that burned under moderate fire intensity (1 % to 80 % scorch). Raking significantly reduced the likelihood of bole charring and bark beetle activity three years post fire. Fuel depth and anticipated fire intensity need to be accounted for to maximize the effectiveness of the treatments. Raking is an important management option to reduce tree mortality from prescribed fire, but is most effective under specific fuel and burning conditions.","Bark beetles; Fire intensity; GLMM; Large tree retention; Restoration",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650473744

However, little is known about the frequency, seasonality, and ignition source of historic fires that shaped these forests. In general, it is believed that fire frequency in upland oak forests of south-central North America was influenced by climate and humans, and decreased since Euro-American settlement; yet there is a dearth of scientific evidence to support this conclusion. The objective of this study was to link the fire history of an upland oak forest in east-central Oklahoma with factors controlling the fire regime. We removed cross-sections from 69 dead post oak (Quercus stellata Wangenh.) trees in a 1 km2 area of old-growth post oak and blackjack oak (Q. marilandica Münchh.) forest, and determined the tree-ring record and exact dates of fire scars from 1750 to 2005, using standard dendrochronological methods. An increase in fire from the eighteenth to early twenty-first centuries appeared to be associated with changes in human occupation, and there was little evidence linking the frequency, severity, or extent of fires to climate factors including drought, lightning, and late-spring frosts. These findings appeared to contradict the belief that fire decreased from the eighteenth to early twenty-first centuries and appeared to emphasize the importance of anthropogenic ignition to the local fire regime.","Anthropogenic ignition; Cross Timbers; Dendrochronology; Fire history; Oak forest; Oklahoma; Post oak; Prescribed burning; Quercus stellata Wangenh",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650445813

Thirty-three large fires (2000-52000ha) were selected and extracted on classified Landsat satellite imagery. The results show that a minimum of 2% and a maximum of 22% of burned areas escaped fire, with an overall average of 10.4%. The many forest patches that partially or entirely escaped fire formed residual habitats (RHs). It was found that although the area of RHs follows a linear relationship with fire size, their proportion appears relatively constant. Spatial analyses showed that the fires could be separated into two groups depending on the physiographic zones (East-Canadian Shield v. West-Clay Belt Lowlands). Fires in the west zone generate less RHs and appear to be associated with more extreme weather conditions. In most cases there was no association with water or wetlands; in some fires the presence of RHs is associated with the proximity of water bodies. The failure to find an association between RHs and wetlands suggests that this type of environment is part of the fuel. Coniferous woodland with moss appears particularly overrepresented within RHs. Our results suggest that the local and regional physiographic conditions strongly influence the creation of RHs; therefore, it is important to consider those differences when applying ecosystem-based management. © IAWF 2010.","fire pattern; physiographic zone; satellite imagery",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78650256453

The once dominant longleaf pine ecosystem is important to many now-threatened and endangered plant and animal species, and land managers are increasing efforts to reestablish this fire-dependent forest. Unfortunately, tree mortality in longleaf pine has been observed following attempts to re-introduce prescribed fire. Root-inhabiting ophiostomatoid fungi and their insect vectors have invaded roots of symptomatic longleaf pine. Although, the relationship between ophiostomatoid fungi and longleaf pine roots is poorly understood. In order to assess the pathogenicity and virulence of four ophiostomatoid fungi to longleaf pine, trees within two broad age classes (20-30 and 40-60 years) were used for root inoculations during the fall of 2006 and 2007 along with the spring of 2007 and 2008. All fungal species consistently caused resin-filled, discolored lesions on the phloem surface extending to the xylem. The successful inoculation of healthy longleaf pine roots confirms the pathogenicity of Grosmannia huntii, Leptographium procerum, Leptographium serpens, and Leptographium terebrantis. G. huntii caused the largest lesions, including 22.20cm2, 13.37cm2, and 9.21cm2 larger than L. procerum, L. terebrantis, and L. serpens respectively. In contrast, L. procerum caused significantly smaller lesions than all other fungi, including 8.65cm2 smaller than L. terebrantis and 10.69cm2 smaller than L. serpens. Restoration efforts of longleaf pine may be affected by fungal root infection in the future. Future studies should focus on the interactions between stress factors associated with longleaf pine to define more clearly the ecological role of root-inhabiting ophiostomatoid fungi in the ecosystem. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Blue-stain fungi; Leptographium; Pathogenicity; Root disease; Virulence",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049262856

Nest searching and monitoring took place within twelve 10-hectare study plots during the breeding seasons of 2003 and 2004. A total of 82 nests representing 23 species were discovered and monitored. Seventy-two percent of those nests were successful in fledging young and 28% failed. Higher quantities of herbaceous material, shrubs, and small diameter trees provided more nesting substrate in Thin/Burn and Burn plots. This study suggests that prescribed burning and a combination of prescribed burning and thinning may be beneficial for Southern Piedmont bird communities, but our conclusions must be considered in light of the small sample sizes of nests. Increasing the area of upland Piedmont forest receiving prescribed burning and thinning treatments could possibly benefit early successional species that are presently experiencing population declines across the United States. © Kilpatrick et al.","Avian nesting success; Fire and fire-surrogate study; Fuel reduction treatments; Piedmont of South Carolina",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-82755181589

Of the 7 species examined, only 2 had top models that included effects of the FFS treatments, the remainder had either constant survival rates, or rates that varied only by study site. The Eastern Towhee had top models that included effects of treatment and study site, while the Red-bellied Woodpecker had top models that included effects of treatment category, time since treatment, and study site. All estimates of treatment, treatment category, and study site were statistically weak with confidence intervals including zero. The lack of clear response patterns observed in this study is likely a consequence of the variability inherent across forest types and taxonomic groups we examined.

To assess potential effects on bark-gleaning birds, we compared the foraging patterns of five cavity-nesting species in thinned and burned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest sites and control sites. We recorded foraging behavior, location on forage tree, and tree characteristics that may be important in the selection of foraging substrates. Foraging surveys were conducted on three replicate 20-ha thinned/burned plots located within larger treatments that ranged from 60 - 250 ha, paired with three replicate control plots. Red-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta canadensis) foraged more often in control sites. Mountain Chickadees (Poecile gambeli) foraged at similar rates on both treatment types. Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus), Hairy Woodpeckers (P. villosus) and White-breasted Nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis) foraged almost exclusively in thinned/burned sites. Overall, all species selectively foraged on larger diameter trees. In control sites, Red-breasted Nuthatches selected larger ponderosa pine trees and Mountain Chickadees selected larger, live trees. In thinned/burned sites, Red-breasted Nuthatches selected larger, live trees, Mountain Chickadees selected larger trees with more canopy connections, Black-backed Woodpeckers selected trees with beetle evidence present and Hairy Woodpeckers selected recently dead trees. These results suggest fuel reduction/forest restoration treatments in dry ponderosa pine forests may be compatible with providing foraging substrates for cavity-nesting species often present in post-fire habitats. © Pierson et al.; Licensee Bentham Open.","Cavity-nesting bird; Chickadee; Foraging; Fuel-reduction; Nuthatch; Prescribed fire; Woodpecker",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-82755181580

Only c.8-10% of this forest remains, nearly all of it degraded by selective logging. During 341 days in 1997-2010, we studied the avifauna of one of the few remaining patches of mature Atlantic Forest in Argentina, Cruce Caballero Provincial Park. In and around this 600-ha park we identified 312 species of birds in 53 families, 280 of them documented by tape-recordings or photographs. Of these species, 19 are globally threatened, 50 threatened in Argentina, and 73 endemic to the Atlantic Forest. The park conserves key populations of Helmeted Woodpecker Dryocopus galeatus, Araucaria Tit-Spinetail Leptasthenura setaria, Bay-ringed Tyrannulet Phylloscartes sylviolus and São Paulo Tyrannulet P. paulista. Other threatened species, including White-bearded Antshrike Biatas nigropectus, Canebrake Groundcreeper Clibanornis dendrocolaptoides and Vinaceous Amazon Amazona vinacea are more common outside the park in the mosaic of small farms and forest fragments between San Pedro and Santa Rosa. Black-fronted Piping Guan Pipile jacutinga appears to be extirpated from the park and Blue-winged Macaw Primolius maracana is apparently extirpated from Argentina. We did not record Bare-throated Bellbird Procnias nudicollis and we consider it hypothetical for the park. The mass flowering and death of takuapi bamboo Merostachys claussenii in 2004-07 generated major changes in the understorey vegetation, resulting in changes in the presence and abundance of many species. To conserve the avifauna of this small Atlantic Forest park it is of key importance to continue to improve environmental education in the surrounding farmlands. Isolation of the park can be avoided by adding neighbouring lots that still support native forest, and by providing small-holder farmers with technical and financial support to promote sustainable crops such as Araucaria angustifolia, rather than the current model of slash-and-burn tobacco farming.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956880107

From 2001 to 2009, we examined roost selection of Indiana myotis in burned and unburned forests in Tucker County, West Virginia. We radiotracked 15 male Indiana myotis to 50 roost trees; 16 in burned stands and 34 in unburned stands. Indiana myotis roosted in stands that had initially been burned 1-3 y prior to our observations. In burned stands, Indiana myotis roosted exclusively in fire-killed maples (Acer spp.). In unburned stands, they roosted in live trees, predominately hickories (Carya spp.), oaks (Quercus spp.), and maples. Roost trees in burned stands were surrounded by less basal area and by trees in advanced stages of decay, creating larger canopy gaps than at random trees in burned stands or actual roost trees located in unburned stands. Compared to random trees in unburned stands, roost trees in unburned stands were less decayed, had higher percent bark coverage, and were surrounded by less basal area, also resulting in larger canopy gaps. Roost-switching frequency and distances moved by Indiana myotis among roost trees were similar between burned and unburned stands. Our research indicates that use of fire for forest management purposes, at minimum provoked no response from Indiana myotis in terms of roost tree selection, and may create additional roost resources, depending on spatial context.","Fernow experimental forest; Forest fire; Indiana myotis; Myotis sodalis; Prescribed fire; Roost selection; West Virginia",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-84887312644

The purpose of the new management area is to restore pre-European settlement forest conditions and recreate habitat for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. Approach: This study explored the effects of restoring an ecosystem, from changes in the growth patterns of individual trees to ecosystem valuation of the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker. It developed procedures for estimating the magnitude of economic impacts resulting from changes in timber production in the pine-bluestem management to project the value of conserving red-cockaded woodpeckers. Results: Over the entire simulation period, pine-bluestem management returns 75% of the undiscounted revenue generated by traditional management (660 versus 875 million dollars). For all 40,245 ha of the new management area managed for pine-bluestem, this cost amounts to $2.9 million per year. When combined with the $137 million decline in the present value of projected timber sale revenue from the area, the total cost rises to $4.2 million per year. Conclusion: The implied value for each pair of woodpeckers is either $10,550 per year for the desired 400 total pairs or $16,880 per year for the 250 reproducing pairs. Judging from the changes resulting from the transition to pine-bluestem management, adopting the new scenario will not cause significant adverse regional economic consequences. The success of the pine-bluestem restoration requires the maintenance of a burning regime that prevents competing vegetation from occupying the middle canopy layer. © 2010 Science Publications.","Economic impact assessment; Ecosystem valuation; Ouachita national forest; Pine-bluestem; Pinus echinata Mill; Red-cockaded woodpecker; Shortleaf pine",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951799801

Thick bark, however, might limit respiration by the living tissues of the trunk. Nevertheless, little research has addressed community-level variation in bark thickness, and to the best of our knowledge, no one has tested multiple hypotheses to explain variation in bark thickness. We conducted an extensive survey of bark thickness within and among species of trees in the tropical rain forests of French Guiana. Trunk bark thickness increased by 1.2 mm per 10 cm increase in stem diameter, and varied widely at all taxonomic levels. Mean trunk bark thickness was 4.5 mm (range: 0.5-29 mm), which was less that found in two Amazonian rain forests in previous studies. This survey of bark thickness should be of use for forest management since tree survival through fire is strongly predicted by bark thickness. We combined the survey data with multiple datasets to test several functional hypotheses proposed to explain variation in bark thickness. We found bark to provide an average of 10% of the flexural rigidity of tree stems, which was substantially less than that found in the only other study of bark stiffness. Bark thickness was uncorrelated with species' association with fire-prone habitats, suggesting that the influence of fire on bark thickness does not extend into moist Forests. There was also little evidence that bark thickness is affected by its function as a defence against herbivory. Nor was there evidence that thick bark limits trunk respiration. A re-analysis of previously collected anatomical data indicated that variation in rhytidome (non-conducting outer bark) thickness explains much of the variation in overall bark thickness. As rhytidome is primarily involved in protecting the living tissues of the trunk, we suggest that bark thickness is driven mostly by its defensive function. Functional explanations for the variation in bark thickness were not clear-cut. Nevertheless, this study provides a foundation for further investigation of the functional bases of bark in tropical trees. © 2010 The Authors.

However, quantitative information about the strength and direction of species associations with broadleaf cover at landscape scales are rare. Uncovering such habitat relationships is essential for understanding the demography of species and in developing sound conservation strategies. It is particularly important to detect points in habitat reduction where rates of population decline may accelerate or the likelihood of species occurrence drops rapidly (i.e., thresholds). Here, we use a large avian point-count data set (N = 4375) from southwestern and northwestern Oregon along with segmented logistic regression to test for thresholds in forest bird occurrence as a function of broadleaf forest and early-seral broadleaf forest at local (150-m radius) and landscape (500-2000-m radius) scales. All 12 bird species examined showed positive responses to either broadleaf forest in general, and/or early-seral broadleaf forest. However, regional variation in species response to these conditions was high. We found considerable evidence for landscape thresholds in bird species occurrence as a function of broadleaf cover; threshold models received substantially greater support than linear models for eight of 12 species. Landscape thresholds in broadleaf forest ranged broadly from 1.35% to 24.55% mean canopy cover. Early-seral broadleaf thresholds tended to be much lower (0.22-1.87%). We found a strong negative relationship between the strength of species association with early-seral broadleaf forest and 42-year bird population trends; species most associated with this forest type have declined at the greatest rates. Taken together, these results provide the first support for the hypothesis that reductions in broadleaf-dominated early-seral forest due to succession and intensive forest management have led to population declines of constituent species in the Pacific northwestern United States. Forest management treatments that maintain or restore even small amounts of broadleaf vegetation could mitigate further declines. © 2010 by the Ecological Society of America.","Broadleaf forest; Early-seral forest; Ecological thresholds; Habitat loss; Intensive forest management; Landscape ecology; Oregon forest birds; Segmented logistic regression; Tree plantations",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78649844870

A sharp increase in dead wood caused by bark beetles in a German national park provides lessons for management of commercial and protected forests. We investigated the effects of dead wood due to bark beetle infestation as well as tree senility on abundance and richness of saproxylic species of beetles. Increasing amounts of spruce dead wood and opening of the canopy by bark beetles had positive effects on the abundance of host-generalist, conifer-specialist, and red-listed saproxylic beetles. Broadleaf specialists were positively associated with the amount of broadleaf dead wood and negatively associated with canopy openness. Gradient analysis of beetle assemblages revealed two major environmental axes: canopy openness and amount of dead wood. We found a threshold for community divergence at a canopy openness of 23% (confidence interval CI: 11-49) and at an amount of dead wood of 64m3ha-1 (CI: 35-160). Critically endangered species served as indicators of dense and open forests, but only when the amount of dead wood was high. Our results suggest that, to maintain saproxylic beetle assemblages, the amount of dead wood in commercial montane forests (at present ≈15m3ha-1) needs to be tripled, with a focus on broadleaf wood in dense stands and spruce wood in open stands. For large protected areas in Europe, our data suggest that bark beetle infestation and senescence without active forest management improves habitat conditions for saproxylic beetles. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Bark beetle; Bavarian Forest National Park; Forest dynamics; Ips typographus; Rewilding; Salvage logging; Threatened species",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956878730

Location: Germany and Central European lowland. Methods: We apply a mechanistic general simulation model to test the response of plant functional types to direct and indirect effects of climate change. Three functional types were chosen to represent a set of well-studied perennial plant species: Juncus atratus, Gentiana pneumonanthe and Primula veris. We link local population dynamics within a heterogeneous, fragmented landscape context. ""Species spheres"", i.e. multi-dimensional parameter ranges rather than single parameter realizations, based on field and literature data served as proxy for life stage transition parameters. Four climatic scenarios summarizing different cumulative weather effects on demographic rates and different local disturbance frequencies were run. The model predicts ""time to extinction"" (TE) and ""proportion of occupied habitat"" (POH) as regional indicators for species extinction risk. Results: TE decreased for all species when weather conditions worsened, and even more so when the frequency of local destructive events additionally increased. However, management towards fewer disturbance events could buffer the negative effect of climate to some extent. The magnitude of these responses varied with species type. POH declined with an increase in bad weather as well as with increasing disturbance frequency. The better the climatic conditions, the less severe were disturbances on population performance. Conclusions: The ""species spheres"" proved to be a valuable approach for predictive trends. As climate change usually also implies destructive events such as land-use change, flooding or fire, our model on local and regional extinction risks can support conservation issues and management actions. © 2010 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Climate change effects on extinction risk; Dynamic landscape; Gentiana pneumonanthe; Juncus atratus; Markov chain Monte Carlo parameter optimization; Model; Plant metapopulation; Primula veris; Species sphere",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956312160

Most salvage logging studies have investigated post-fire salvage, often clearcutting, and impacts documented in these studies may be more severe than selective logging prescriptions applied to forests affected by beetle outbreaks. We evaluated the effects of selective salvage logging on avian nest survival in beetle-killed lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forests on the Fremont and Winema National Forests, south-central Oregon, USA, 1997-1999. Using logistic-exposure models, we found that nest survival for weak (period nest survival: 0.64; 95% CL: 0.50, 0.75) and strong (period nest survival: 0.71; 95% CL: 0.46, 0.87) cavity nesters was significantly higher than for ground nesters (period nest survival: 0.31; 95% CL: 0.18, 0.46), while nest survival for open cup nesting birds (period nest survival: 0.57; 95% CL: 0.47, 0.66) was intermediate. We did not find significant differences in nest survival for American robin (Turdus migratorius), chipping sparrow (Spizella passerine), dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis), dusky flycatcher (Empidonax oberholseri), mountain chickadee (Poecile gambeli), or yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) (these six species comprised ∼80% of the sample). Our results suggest that, unlike post-fire salvage logging, selective harvesting prescriptions after beetle outbreaks may be suitable for meeting multiple management objectives, including generating a flow of commodities and maintaining avian nest survival rates. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Beetle outbreaks; Biodiversity management; Forest breeding birds; Nest survival; Pinus contorta; Salvage logging; Snags",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957012822

Using line transects we surveyed the bird community of a natural Pinus canariensis forest burned in the summer of 2007 on Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Our goal was to identify important environmental variables and the thresholds that influenced the pattern of bird abundance at the community, foraging guild, and species-specific level. Models were constructed by means of regression trees and cross validation applying the 1-SE rule. Mixed results were observed and only 2 species were clearly affected by fire severity. Overall, total bird abundance, total species richness, and total bird diversity were positively influenced by low, very low, and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively, and the presence of either Erica or Myrica shrubs. Consequently, high canopy fire severity had an overall negative effect on bird community characteristics. Abundance of Myrica shrubs affected positively general ground foragers such as common blackbird (Turdus merula cabrerae) and Canary Islands chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis), a canopy forager. The number of thin trees was important for canopy foragers such as goldcrest (Regulus regulus teneriffae) and African blue tit (Cyanistes teneriffae teneriffae), but also for a bark forager, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major canariensis). European robin (Erithacus rubecula superbus) and the ubiquitous endemic blue chaffinch (Friugilla teydea teydea) were influenced by low and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively.

Predicting the effectiveness of these strategies is a challenge for species whose habitat relationships may involve multiple factors and can vary among sites. For 2 years, we live-trapped a common, late-successional microtine rodent, the southern red-backed vole (Myodes formerly Clethrionomys gapperi), in 40 1.4-ha boreal mixedwood sites in Ontario, Canada. Using a neighborhood-scale modeling approach, we related red-backed vole capture locations to spatially referenced measures of overstory trees, shrubs and saplings, downed woody debris (DWD), and forest floor substrate. We further assessed how associations with these features varied with availability of the features within a site and as a function of stand management history. In spring, red-backed voles were associated with trap stations that had, within a 26-m radius, a dense shrub layer, abundant late-decay DWD, coniferous understory and litter, and possibly, understory vegetation associated with moist conditions. Positive associations with shrub cover, late-decay DWD, and a moisture-associated understory were most apparent in sites in which these elements were scarce (e.g., <1,500 stems/ha of hardwood saplings and short shrubs; <0.8 projected ground cover of late-decay DWD). The importance of late-decay DWD; shade-tolerant, coniferous understory composition; and substrate varied depending on a site's management history, with each feature having a strong positive effect in 4764-year-old stands that were harvested using horse skidding and weaker effects in both 3140-year-old stands that were clearcut with mechanical skidding and >80-year-old fire-origin stands. Our models of fine-scale habitat relationships for red-backed voles may be useful in establishing structural retention guidelines suitable for wildlife species dependent on late-successional habitat structure. In this regard, retaining abundant DWD and 1030 live trees at harvest may be effective management strategies for providing favorable habitat conditions at localized scales. © 2010 The Wildlife Society.","boreal forest; Clethrionomys; ecosystem management; habitat thresholds; Myodes gapperi; neighborhood modeling; Ontario; red-backed vole; small mammal",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77956211424

The papers in this Fire Ecology special issue describe recent advances in fire effects prediction for key classes of direct (first-order) fire effects. Important gaps in predictive capabilities exist in pre-, active-, and post-fire measurement technology; in our ability to predict heat deposition to soil and plant surfaces from knowledge of fuels and models that simulate smoldering combustion, flame spread, and plume dynamics; in our ability to predict above and below ground plant heating and injury; in our understanding of the physiological causes of plant mortality; and in our knowledge of direct effects of fire on fauna and their habitats. Fire effects on shrub and grassland systems are particularly poorly studied. Recent advances in software systems, in which multiple models and databases are included in a single application tailored to address fire management questions, give impetus to foundational fire effects research that would improve fire effects prediction. In this introduction, we describe the range of approaches to predicting fire effects, from statistical to process; we define terminology used throughout the issue; and we highlight research and development needs. We offer the following goal as a challenge to the research community: the development of a comprehensive, first-order fire effects model employing a diversity of approaches (from statistical to process) and built to serve a range of applications (from research to land management).","Fauna; Fire effects; Fire metrology; Fire modeling; Fire monitoring; Flora",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954236124

We investigated the effects of fire severity on the long-term occupancy of burns by (i) saproxylic insects and (ii) three wood-foraging birds. Based on observations made 6 to 11 years after fire in burned conifer forests that varied in fire severity in Quebec, Canada, our results indicate that low-severity portions of the burns likely provided snag conditions suitable for the long-term presence of deadwood-associated insects and birds. The black-backed woodpecker, a post-fire forest specialist, was still abundant 6 and 8 years after fire. This pattern was likely explained by the persistence of several saproxylic insect species that are associated with recently dead trees and by the positive effect of lower fire severity on the abundance of Arhopalus foveicollis, a cerambycid with a long life cycle in dead wood. The American three-toed woodpecker and the brown creeper, and their associated prey (Scolytinae beetles), were more abundant in burned stands of lower v. higher severity. We conclude that less severely burned snags and stands within high-severity burns may favour the long-term presence of trophic webs that involve saproxylic insects and wood-foraging birds in burned boreal forests. © 2010 IAWF.","American three-toed woodpecker; Arhopalus foveicollis; black spruce; black-backed woodpecker; brown creeper; Cerambycidae; Certhia americana; Picoides arcticus; Picoides dorsalis; Scolytinae.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954095495

We used Mahalanobis distance methods to develop predictive models of white-headed woodpecker (Picoides albolarvatus) nesting habitat in postfire ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-dominated landscapes on the Fremont-Winema National Forests in south central Oregon, USA. The 1-km radius (314 ha) surrounding 45 nest sites was open-canopied before fire and a mosaic of burn severities after wildfire. The 1-ha surrounding nests of white-headed woodpeckers had fewer live trees per hectare and more decayed and larger diameter snags than at non-nest sites. The leading cause of nest failure seemed to be predation. Habitat and abiotic features were not associated with nest survival. High daily survival rates and little variation within habitat features among nest locations suggest white-headed woodpeckers were consistently selecting high suitability habitats. Management activities that open the forest canopy and create conditions conducive to a mosaic burn pattern will probably provide suitable white-headed woodpecker nesting habitat after wildfire. When making postfire salvage logging decisions, we suggest that retention of larger, more decayed snags will provide nesting habitat in recently burned forests. © 2010 The Wildlife Society.","habitat suitability model; Mahalanobis distance; nest survival; nest-site selection; ponderosa pine; snags; white-headed woodpecker; wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953932385

Because greater forage quality yields greater deer growth and productivity and intensively managed pine forests are common in the southeastern United States, forest managers would benefit from an understanding of fire and herbicide effects on forage availability to improve habitat conditions for deer. Therefore, we evaluated independent and combined effects of fire and herbicide (i.e., imazapyr) on forage biomass and deer nutritional carrying capacity (CC) on land owned and managed by Weyerhaeuser NR Company in east-central Mississippi, USA. We used a randomized complete block design of 6 pine plantations (blocks) divided into 4 10-ha treatment plots to each of which we randomly assigned a treatment (burn-only, herbicide-only, burn herbicide, and control). We estimated biomass (kg/ha) of moderate-and high-use deer forage plants during July of 19992008, then estimated CC for diets to support either body maintenance (6 crude protein) or lactation (14 crude protein) with a nutritional constraints model. Herbaceous forages responded positively to fire and herbicide application. In most years, CC estimates for maintenance and lactation were greater in burn herbicide than in controls. Maintenance-level CC was always greater in burn herbicide than in controls, except at 1 year posttreatment. Burn herbicide was 2.6-8.3 times greater (x ̄ 4.0) than control for lactation-level CC in 8 of 9 years posttreatment.

For species that are non-migratory, territorial and monogamous, winter conditions may result in within-pair competition. However, little is known about how monogamous pairs coexist on their winter territories. We investigated temporal patterns in male-female interactions of the New Zealand robin (Petroica australis) to better understand mechanisms of coexistence during winter. Previous work has shown that male robins are physically dominant over females and maintain priority access to food year-round. We quantified female behaviour throughout the 2008 non-breeding season to better understand how females coexist with physically dominant males on winter territories. Results showed that pairs rarely forage in close proximity in autumn and winter, suggesting females avoid males at this time of year. Males and females begin to spend more time foraging together as winter turns to spring. During this winter-spring transitional period, females steal large amounts of food hoarded by males. These results indicate that male and female New Zealand robins use different behavioural mechanisms to coexist on their winter territories. While males are dominant physically, females show a seasonally variable strategy where they avoid males in autumn and winter, and then steal male-made caches from early spring until the onset of inter-pair cooperation and the breeding season. © New Zealand Ecological Society.","Cache; Competition; Sexual conflict; Winter behaviour",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953038159

We manipulated a burned forest area on a Mediterranean mountain to experimentally analyze the effect of salvage logging on bird-species abundance, diversity, and assemblage composition. We used a randomized block design with three plots of approximately 25 ha each, established along an elevational gradient in a recently burned area in Sierra Nevada Natural and National Park (southeastern Spain). Three replicates of three treatments differing in postfire burned wood management were established per plot: salvage logging, nonintervention, and an intermediate degree of intervention (felling and lopping most of the trees but leaving all the biomass). Starting 1 year after the fire, we used point sampling to monitor bird abundance in each treatment for 2 consecutive years during the breeding and winter seasons (720 censuses total). Postfire burned-wood management altered species assemblages. Salvage logged areas had species typical of openand early-successional habitats. Bird species that inhabit forests were still present in the unsalvaged treatments even though trees were burned, but were almost absent in salvage-logged areas. Indeed, the main dispersers of midand late-successional shrubs and trees, such as thrushes (Turdus spp.) and the European Jay (Garrulus glandarius) were almost restricted to unsalvaged treatments. Salvage logging might thus hamper the natural regeneration of the forest through its impact on assemblages of bird species. Moreover, salvage logging reduced species abundance by 50% and richness by 40%, approximately.

Our aim here is to evaluate the impact of such management practices over the long term, and of fire severity over the short term, on avifauna. Bird-habitat stations were distributed in broom shrublands from a few months to 51 years after fire, at 1400-2100 m a.s.l. Overall, shrub cover was the main habitat variable affecting the bird community composition. The abundance trends of bird species for half a century after fire were varied, but population recovery seemed slower (especially in the Dartford warbler Sylvia undata) than it had been reported at a lower altitude. Three species of European conservation concern (. Alauda arvensis, Lullula arborea and Lanius collurio) showed abundance peaks at 10-19 years after fire. This time interval showed the highest species richness, abundance and conservation value, whereas shrub cover continued to increase afterwards. The bird assemblage tended to impoverish with increasing fire severity in the first year after a fire. Our results emphasize: (1) the slow recovery of bird community of burnt mountain shrublands; (2) the need for long-term biodiversity assessments to help improve planning of fire intervals at different altitudes; (3) the relevance of reducing fire severity due to its impact on fauna. © 2009 The Authors.

Thus, the Bachman's Warbler was a cultural ecological- dependent species. It may at first seem strange to describe a bird species as dependent on cultural ecological practices (mainly burning for agriculture in this case), but the Bachman's Warbler was indeed dependent on the ecosystem - canebrakes - that Native American land use practices produced and maintained.

However, the extinction of species is typically not instant, but rather involves a time lag. Species richness in recently disturbed habitats is therefore expected to reflect past rather than current habitat availability, with the set of species eventually going extinct representing extinction debt. We explored current species richness of butterflies (Lepidoptera: Rhopalocera) and burnet moths (Lepidoptera: Zygaenidae) with respect to past and current habitat characteristics. The study was conducted in calcareous grasslands, a habitat that has suffered a rapid decline in Europe during the last century. We showed that species richness of habitat specialists correlated positively with both past (75. years ago) and current habitat area, and was best explained by a model incorporating both of these variables. The independent effect of past habitat area presumably indicates the presence of extinction debt in the study region. Species requiring large habitat areas were more likely to show signs of extinction debt. Species richness of other grassland butterflies (those not confined to the focal habitat type) was not associated with past or current habitat area, the pattern indicating their lower sensitivity to changes in focal habitats. The response to habitat loss in specialist butterflies appears faster than in specialist plants, studied in the same landscape earlier. We conclude that linking patterns of species diversity with the temporal dynamics of habitats substantially improves the understanding of the variation in species diversity, and thus helps to identify species of conservation concern. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Butterfly conservation; Calcareous grassland; Extinction debt; Habitat loss; Species richness; Time lag",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954814804

To assess the impact of thinning and burning on reptiles and small mammals, we installed trapping grids in eight thinned and burned sites, each paired with untreated controls. Of the eight pairs, four were in rehabilitated sites (planted with nonlocal species) and four were in restored sites (seeded with local species). Thinning and burning had no significant impact on the small mammal community, although Cercatetus concinnus was more abundant in rehabilitated sites. In contrast, thinning and burning significantly increased reptile abundance and species richness, with two species (Morethia obscura and Menetia greyii) only recorded in thinned and burned sites. We concluded that thinning and burning was a successful management option in revegetated mine pits in jarrah forests, particularly because reptile communities created by thinning and burning were more similar to those in unmined forest. Although published studies for comparison are few, we expect thinning and burning to have generally positive effects on reptile communities in forest ecosystems where fire is an important disturbance agent. Our study emphasizes the importance of monitoring revegetated areas over time periods sufficient to detect deviations from desired successional trajectories, so that management options, such as thinning and burning, can be implemented if required. © 2009 Society for Ecological Restoration International.","Forest; Jarrah; Mammal; Management; Monitoring; Rehabilitation; Reptile; Restoration; Succession",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77953688818

Depredation of threatened reptile and amphibian populations by wild pigs could be substantial. By understanding depredation characteristics and rates, more resources can be directed toward controlling populations of wild pigs coincident with threatened or endangered herpetofauna populations. From April 2005 to March 2006 we used firearms to collect wild pigs (n = 68) and examined stomach content for reptiles and amphibians. We found 64 individual reptiles and amphibians, composed of 5 different species, that were consumed by wild pigs during an estimated 254 hours of foraging. Primarily arboreal species (e.g., Anolis carolinensis) became more vulnerable to depredation when temperatures were low and they sought thermal shelter. Other species (e.g., Scaphiopus holbrookii) that exhibit mass terrestrial migrations during the breeding season also faced increased vulnerability to depredation by wild pigs. Results suggest that wild pigs are opportunistic consumers that can exploit and potentially have a negative impact on species with particular life-history characteristics. © 2009 American Society of Mammalogists.","Anolis carolinensis; Consumption; Feral pig; Predation; Scaphiopus holbrookii; Sus scrofa; Wild pig",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951263723

The tree is susceptible to insect damage and is attacked by leaf eaters, termites, root grubs, sapsuckers, gall formers, stem borers, pod borers and fruit borers. The mango mealybug Drosicha mangiferae Green (Hemiptera: Monophlebidae) is one of the most destructive pests in the Indo-Pak subcontinent, sometimes causing premature fruit drop. A combination of several management strategies such as use of entomopathogens, chemical insecticides and burning of adult females has been used to control D. mangiferae. Overreliance on insecticides has eliminated natural enemies, and we were therefore interested in investigating the impact of alternative insect pest management strategies such as cultural and mechanical techniques on D. mangiferae. The results of our studies suggested that different bands significantly stopped the upward movement of overwintering and surviving populations of D. mangiferae. To augment the bands' results, mounding the tree with debris on a plastic sheet once a year was the most effective technique and resulted in maximum reduction of the nymphal population of D. mangiferae. The newly developed Haider band-designed in our laboratory in the present studies-was very successful in the field in controlling the upward movement of newly hatched nymphs on trees: only 0.8% of the nymphs crossed the band. Only 7% to 10% of the nymphs crossed plastic sheets, polyethylene sheets and funnel bands. The cotton and gunny bag (jute) bands were the least effective: 42% of the nymphs managed to cross them. The results suggested that employing cultural practices and bands together could reduce the need for insecticide treatments and offer a sustainable method for D. mangiferae control. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Cultural control; Haider band; Mangifera indica; Mango; Physical control",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77954243011

In addition, the nesting biology of the Burrowing Owl (Athene cunicularia) has been studied in numerous environments, but not in tropical grasslands managed by fire. This study examined the effects of fire management on the nesting biology of A. cunicularia in Emas National Park, State of Goias, central Brazilian Cerrado. We compared the number of breeding pairs and their burrows in October and November 2009 at 15 study sites in grasslands managed by fire (firebreaks) and unmanaged grasslands adjacent to and distant from firebreaks. We visited active burrows two-four times and described the burrow entrances and sentinel sites and counted and observed adults and young. A total of 19 burrows were found at firebreaks. One and two burrows were found in grasslands adjacent to and distant from firebreaks, respectively. For all burrows found, one to three young reached the adult size, being able to fly and/or run in early November. The 22 burrows found were in the ground, associated or not with termite and ant nests. Most (86.4%) burrows had only one entrance. Only three burrows had two or three entrances. Structures used as sentinel perches by adults were mounds in front of the burrow entrances, termite nests, shrubs and trees. Most of these sentinel sites were shorter than 2 m high and located less than 10 m from the burrow entrance. At Emas National Park, firebreaks appear to provide more attractive conditions to the nesting of A. cunicularia than unmanaged grasslands, likely because of the short herbaceous stratum due to frequent burning of firebreaks. This study suggests that fire management provides suitable conditions for the successful reproduction of A. cunicularia in firebreaks at Emas National Park.","Burrowing owl; Firebreak; Landscape; Reproduction; Savanna",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77957994225

Our objective was to characterize the roles of (a) spatial population processes (related to dispersal), (b) changes in forest structure (due to forest maturation and management), and (c) landscape composition (resulting from afforestation and fires) in the range expansion of these bird species at the landscape scale (10 × 10 km). After correcting for the differences in sampling effort, colonizations appeared to be more likely near areas in which the species had been present in the 1980s. Patterns of the range expansion were also strongly associated with forest maturation, which seems to affect the spatial arrangement of birds at multiple scales. Changes in forest landscape composition due to afforestation and fires were minor determinants of range changes, and forest management did not seem to prevent range expansion at the spatial scale studied. Colonization events appeared to be driven primarily by landscape changes occurring in nearby localities rather than within the colonized locations themselves, presumably because of source-sink dynamics and connectivity patterns. Our results showed that in Catalonia, at a landscape scale, the impact of forest management on forest bird communities is much smaller than the impact of the widespread maturation of forests following a large-scale decline in traditional uses. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

All study areas were managed for timber production through planned harvests or postfire salvage logging. Bluebirds laid a mean clutch of 5.3 ± 0.1 (SE) eggs (n = 131), and successful nests fledged an average of 4.5 ± 0.2 young (n = 85). Using a model-selection framework, we found that nest survival was a function of clutch size and treatment and that there was a quadratic effect of nest age. Daily survival rates decreased after the onset of incubation, then increased through the nestling period, and were higher for clutches with ≥5 eggs and in stands that were burned and salvaged. Survivorship over the entire period for clutches (n = 131 nests) with ≤4, 5, and ≥6 eggs was 0.39 (95% CI: 0.11, 0.65), 0.61 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.80), and 0.71 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.85), respectively. Vegetation variables associated with nest sites did not significantly affect nest survival. Predation accounted for the most nest failures (34% of nests). We suggest that parental defense of nests accounts for the quadratic effect of nest age, with adult bluebirds defending nests more aggressively as nestlings approach fledging, and that bluebirds laying larger clutches are older, more experienced birds, resulting in greater nest survival. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2010.","Cavity-nesting bird; Clutch size; Forest burns; Nest survival; Ponderosa pine; Sialia mexicana; Western Bluebird",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949478865

Effects of fire, however, can vary with environmental setting. We examined riparian fire along the free-flowing Upper San Pedro River (Arizona) by making temporal comparisons supplemented by spatial contrasts between burned and unburned sites. Pre-fire, Populus fremontii and Salix gooddingii were dominant species, with Tamarix sparse in the understory. Species differed in mortality and resprout rates, producing post-fire vegetation change. Mortality was highest for Tamarix, intermediate for Salix, and lowest for Populus, and also varied among size classes. Resprout rate was low for Populus, high for Salix, and also high for the few surviving Tamarix. The net effect was changes in population size structure (relative shifts towards larger Populus but smaller individuals of other species) and forest composition (decreased abundance of Tamarix relative to Populus and Salix), and in spatial distribution of stems. Tamarix's low ability to survive fire resulted from competitive suppression by Populus and Salix, with their dominance a product of the site's flow regime.

Currently, the ecological consequences of post-fire salvage logging are insufficiently understood to develop effective management guidelines or to adequately inform policy decision-makers. We used both field and laboratory studies to examine the effects of post-fire salvage logging on populations of the white-spotted sawyer Monochamus scutellatus scutellatus (Say) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae) and its ecological function in boreal forest. Monochamus s. scutellatus adults were relatively abundant in both burned and clear-cut logged sites but were absent from salvage logged sites. An in situ mesocosm experiment showed that the abundance of M. s. scutellatus larvae in burned white spruce bolts was linked to changes in total organic nitrogen and carbon in mineral soil. Organic nutrient inputs in the form of M. s. scutellatus frass increased mineral soil microbial respiration rates by more than three-fold and altered the availability of nitrogen. Changes in nitrogen availability corresponded with decreased germination and growth of Epilobium angustifolium and Populus spp. but not Calamagrostis canadensis. Although the present study focused on local scale effects, the reported findings suggest that continued economic emphasis on post-fire salvage logging may have implications beyond the local scale for biodiversity conservation, nutrient cycling and plant community composition in forest ecosystems recovering from wildfire. © 2009 The Royal Entomological Society.","Beetle frass; Boreal forest; Coarse woody debris; IPDM; Monochamus s. scutellatus (Say); Nitrogen cycling; Saproxylic beetles; Soil microbial activity; Wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-74549158818

Lowering of the acceptable daily concentration of particulate matter from 65 to 35 μg/m 3 will bring much closer scrutiny of prescribed burning practices from the air quality community. To work within this narrow window, land managers need simple tools to allow them to estimate their potential emissions and examine trade-offs between continued use of prescribed fire and other means of fuels management. A critical part of the emissions estimation process is determining the amount of fuel consumed during the burn. This study combines results from a number of studies along the Upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina to arrive at a simple means of estimating total fuel consumption on prescribed fires. The result is a simple linear relationship that determines the total fuel consumed as a function of the product of the preburn fuel load and the burning index of the National Fire Danger Rating System.","Emissions; Fuel consumption; Prescribed fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77249102115

Four experimental units, each > 14 ha, were contained within each of three replicate blocks. Treatments were (1) prescribed burning, (2) mechanical felling of shrubs and small trees, (3) mechanical felling + burning, and (4) untreated controls. Mechanical understory felling was conducted in winter 2001-2002, and prescribed burning was conducted in March 2003. Mechanical felling burning resulted in greater canopy openness compared with the other treatments as a result of hotter fires and elevated levels of subsequent tree mortality. Burning reduced leaf litter depth in both burned treatments by >80%. We captured 6,776 individual macroarthropods (460 g of dry biomass) within 22 identified orders and 59 identified families. Coleoptera and Hymenoptera were numerically dominant (27.3 and 25.9%, respectively); Lepidoptera larvae also were a dominant component of dry biomass (37%). We found no differences among treatments in the relative abundance or dry biomass of total ground-dwelling macroarthropods or within most orders; Hymenoptera (predominantly Formicidae) dry biomass was greater with mechanical felling burning than with mechanical felling. Total relative abundance and dry biomass were low in spring and higher in late summer. Our results indicate that prescribed burning and mechanical fuel reduction treatments conducted in winter or early spring have little impact on the community composition, relative abundance, or biomass of total arthropods or most arthropod orders and families, at least in the short term. However, because we did not use a killing agent, our trapping method probably undersampled macroarthropods that could climb or fly from traps, and results for those groups should be interpreted cautiously. Our study suggests that the fuel reduction methods studied may be used as a land management tool in upland hardwood forest with little effect on macroarthropod communities or the ground-dwelling arthropod prey base for vertebrates.","Burn; Fire surrogate; Fuel reduction; Macroarthropods; Southern Appalachians; Upland hardwoods",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76749115603

To reduce this threat and improve overall forest health, land managers are designing landscape-scale treatments that strategically locate thinning and burning treatments to disrupt fuel continuity, allowing managed wildfires to burn the remaining area. A necessary step in designing and evaluating these treatments is understanding their ecological effects on wildlife. We used meta-analysis to compare effects of small-diameter removal (thinnings and shelterwoods) and burning treatments, selective harvesting, overstory removal (including clearcutting), and wildfire on wildlife species in southwestern conifer forests. We hypothesized that small-diameter removal and burning treatments would have minimal effects on wildlife compared to other treatments. We found 33 studies that met our criteria by (1) comparing density or reproductive output for wildlife species, (2) using forest management or wildfire treatments, (3) implementing control-impact or before-after control-impact design using unmanaged stands as controls, and (4) occurring in Arizona or New Mexico ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) or mixed conifer (Abies/Picea/Pinus) forest. The 22 studies suitable for meta-analysis occurred ≤20 years post-treatment on sites <400 ha. Small-diameter harvest and burning treatments had positive effects but thin/burn and selective harvest treatments had no detectable effect on most small mammals and passerine bird species reported in studies; overstory removal and wildfire resulted in an overall negative response. We examined foraging guild responses to treatments; ground-foraging birds and rodents had no strong response. Aerial-, tree-, and bole-foraging birds had positive or neutral responses to the small-diameter removal and burning treatments, but negative responses to overstory removal and wildfire. Small-diameter removal and burning treatments as currently being implemented in the Southwest do not negatively impact most of the wildlife species in the studies we examined in the short-term (≤10 years). We believe a combination of treatments in a patchy arrangement across the landscape will result in the highest diversity and density. We recommend that managers implement thinning and burning treatments, but that future research efforts focus on long-term responses of species at larger spatial scales, use reproductive output as a more informative response variable, and target species for which there is a paucity of data. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Many biophysical and socioeconomic factors have been used in quantitative analyses of wildfire risk. However, the importance and effects of socioeconomic factors in spatial modelling have been given inadequate attention. In this paper, we use different approaches to spatially model our data to examine the influence of human activity on wildfire ignition in the south west of the Madrid region, central Spain. We examine the utility of choropleth and dasymetric mapping with both Euclidean and functional distance surfaces for two differently defined wildfire seasons. We use a method from Bayesian statistics, the Weights of Evidence model, and produce ten predictive maps of wildfire risk: (1) five maps for a two-month fire season combining datasets of evidence variables and (2) five maps for the four-month fire season using the same dataset combinations. We find that the models produced from a choropleth mapping approach with spatial variables using Euclidian and functional distance surfaces are the best of the ten models. Results indicate that spatial patterns of wildfire ignition are strongly associated with human access to the natural landscape.

Limited distribution of many rare species in increasingly fragmented habitats and uncertainty of whether rare species tolerate, require, or persist through avoidance of fire hampers fire management when it is possible and threatens long-term viability of plants. We review up to 14 years of monitoring data for 18 rare plant species from 14 families occurring on sandhill, scrub, pine rockland, and mixed deciduous hardwood communities across Florida. For a number of variables measured, including density, frequency, flowering, and recruitment, 50% of the species showed significant positive responses to burning and 50% of the species showed a neutral or no response. None of the species were unable to recover post-burn.

These outbreaks are managed through removal of trees infested with mountain pine beetles to control mountain pine beetle populations and salvage timber resources. To minimize impacts to black-backed woodpeckers while meeting management objectives, there is a need to identify characteristics of these areas that support black-backed woodpeckers. We examined the habitat associations of this species nesting in areas of beetle outbreaks in the Black Hills, South Dakota in 2004 and 2005. We used an information theoretic approach and discrete choice models to evaluate nest-site selection of 42 woodpecker nests at 3 spatial scales-territory, nest area, and nest tree. At the territory scale (250 m around nest), availability and distribution of food best explained black-backed woodpecker selection of beetle outbreaks versus the surrounding forest. Selection at the territory scale was positively associated with densities of trees currently infested by mountain pine beetles and indices of wood borer (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) abundance, and was greatest at distances of 50-100 m from the nearest patch of infestation. At the nest-area scale (12.5 m radius around the nest), densities of snags positively influenced nest-area selection. Finally, at the nest-tree scale, aspen (Populus tremuloides) and 3-5-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) snags were important resources. The association between abundant wood-boring insects and black-backed woodpeckers creates a difficult challenge for forest managers. In the absence of fire, areas of beetle outbreak might serve as the only substantial source of habitat in the Black Hills. Regulating insect populations via salvage logging will reduce key food resources to black-backed woodpeckers during nesting. Therefore, given the relatively infrequent occurrence of large-scale fire in the Black Hills, management should recognize the importance of beetle-killed forests to the long-term viability of the black-backed woodpecker population in the Black Hills. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Discrete choice; Habitat; Picoides arcticus; Post-fire; Wood borer",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449715066

We investigated how the amount and spatial arrangement of high-severity patches varied among 20 fires that occurred in Arizona and New Mexico, USA, across gradients in fire size and climate. The climate gradient was based on the Multivariate El Niño Southern Oscillation Index. In the southwestern US, cool dry conditions are prevalent in La Niña at one extreme, and at the other end, warm wet conditions occur in El Niño. Fires were generally larger in La Niña climates; however, several fires deviated from this trend. Moreover, some spatial properties of severity did not correspond to fire size or to changes in climate. Within the nine largest fires, we analyzed the influence of landscape characteristics defined by topographic discontinuity on spatial patterns of fire severity. Characteristics of topography altered spatial patterns of severity at some places within all the nine fires, and we identified thresholds where small changes in terrain resulted in dramatic effects on severity. From a management perspective, consideration of the spatial configuration of severely burned areas can help qualify judgments based on fire size or severity composition alone by linking pattern to ecological processes of interest. Furthermore, examination of individual fire events could lead to identification of climate contexts in which fires can meet management objectives for sustainable forests.","Arizona; Climate change; Fire severity; Forest fire ecology; Generalized Additive Models; New Mexico; Ponderosa pine; Southwestern USA; Spatial pattern metrics; Topographic gradients",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70449558778

The accuracy of fire severity measurements will be affected if trees that initially appear to be fire-killed prove to be viable after longer observation. Our goal was to quantify the extent to which three common Sierra Nevada conifer species may 'flush' (produce new foliage in the year following a fire from scorched portions of the crown) and survive after fire, and to identify tree or burn characteristics associated with survival. We found that, among ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex. Laws) and Jeffrey pines (Pinus jeffreyi Grev. Balf) with 100% initial crown scorch (no green foliage following the fire), the majority of mature trees flushed, and survived. Red fir (Abies magnifica A. Murr.) with high crown scorch (mean = 90%) also flushed, and most large trees survived.

Although natural fire was suppressed through much of the 20th century, in the late 20th century, fire was reintroduced into many ecosystems in the form of prescribed burning. The effects of fire on insect populations are not well understood. The objective of this study was to assess the effects of prescribed fire, tree species, and tree size on black carpenter ant abundance and distribution. The effects of prescribed fire, tree species group, and tree dbh on black carpenter occurrence were studied using a presence-absence baited test on 3,556 trees in the oak-hickory forests of the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. Trees were distributed over unburned areas and areas burned in the dormant seasons of 2005, 2006, and 2007. Black carpenter ants occurred most frequently at baits on large red oaks and least frequently at baits on small hickories, suggesting that they preferentially forage on certain tree species and sizes. Occurrence of black carpenter ants varied by fire treatment. Habitat alterations are likely to be a cause of ant occurrence patterns in oak-hickory forests, but additional studies are necessary to understand the mechanism behind this trend.

Using several large burn units (61-242 ha) within the Ozark ecosystem, I measured the effect of the time elapsed since sites were burned on the density of white-tailed deer and the larval life stage of A. americanum. Larval tick densities were highest in areas that were 2 yr postburn and were >6 times higher than tick densities in control units. Deer densities were highest in sites that were burned in the same year as this study and decreased significantly with time since burn. These results suggest that intensive use of postburn sites by white-tailed deer may increase the abundance of A. americanum to levels greater than occurs in sites that remain unburned.

Snag densities under a high-retention shelterwood system were consistently lower than those in the fire-suppression and surface-fire scenarios, even if no large snags were felled at the time of harvest. Regular inputs from harvest residues were important in maintaining the total volume of DWD, but this material tended to be concentrated in a narrow range of decay classes at any given time.

Current snag management practices in Newfoundland recommend a minimum of 10 snags/ha on the post-harvest landscape. Snags declined significantly in the first two decades of the chronosequence. The rapid rate of decline in snag density which occurred immediately post harvest was likely attributable to windfall and domestic harvest for firewood. A second rapid rate of snag density decline occurred 10-15 years post harvest which potentially reflected the average lifespan of snags in western Newfoundland. Average snag densities approximated the minimum management goal during the period from 15 to 60 years since harvest (YSH). However, 53-60% of sites sampled in the 15-60 YSH period contained <10 snags/ha. Snag densities then increased with forest age, again reaching high levels 81-100 YSH which were comparable to the density at the beginning of the chronosequence.

I reviewed the published literature for hollow-using Australian birds and microbats to document their tree-hollow requirements and to guide future research and management. Such information is vital to the conservation of these species. The hollow requirements of only 35 of 114 hollow-using bird species and 15 of 42 hollow-using microbat species were documented in some detail. This overall paucity of information limits the ability to manage for the future requirements of species. However, some generalisations can guide management until further studies are conducted. Most species used a variety of available tree species, and the extensive use of dead trees probably reflects the high likelihood of these trees containing hollows. Birds (other than large parrots) and bats chose hollow entrances of a size close to body width. Large parrots require large hollows, with a preference for large vertical spouts and trunk hollows. Few birds or bats demonstrated an absolute requirement for high (10m) tree hollows, with most (70%) using some hollows with entrances ≤5m above ground. Temperature has been postulated to influence roost selection among microbats because it enables passive rewarming from torpor and there is some evidence from Australian bats to support this. Many studies suggest a future shortage of hollow-bearing trees. Currently, artificial hollows appear to be the most likely interim solution to address this. Knowledge of the natural hollow requirements of species can be used to refine artificial-hollow designs. An increase in research effort is needed to address the many gaps in knowledge that currently exist. Priorities for research include (1) many additional studies to document the characteristics of the hollow-bearing trees used by species of microbat, (2) the need to conduct long-term bioregional studies of hollow-bearing tree attrition to help identify where management responses are most needed and (3) investigating whether fire plays a significant role in the creation of tree hollows of a range of size classes and therefore may have a management use.

In recognition of the fact that the relative amount of older forest stands may be lost over time due to wildfire, forest harvesting, insect infestation, windthrow and other factors, growing attention is being paid to the potential for stand-level structural retention practices to mitigate impacts of forestry on wildlife. This literature review examines our current state of knowledge of the short- and long-term responses of vertebrate wildlife (birds, mammals, and amphibians) to various stand-level management practices that manipulate the quantity and quality of live trees, snags, understorey vegetation, and coarse woody debris (CWD) available to wildlife post-harvest. While superficially, there appeared to be a broad body of research on which to base such a review, on closer examination, relevant material was limited by a failure of many studies to explicitly account for stand-level structure, or to do so at an appropriate scale, and by the highly variable quality of the research, particularly with regard to mammal responses. Both green tree retention (GTR) and well developed understory practices appear to enhance both the short- and long-term habitat value of stands for the broadest array of wildlife groups. CWD retention was found to have a significant influence on marten and their prey, possibly in concert with overstorey and understorey retention. No patterns in wildlife responses to snag retention were apparent. There was insufficient information to draw conclusions on optimal quantities or spatial configurations for any of the structural variables reviewed. Key information gaps identified in this review include our lack of knowledge of stand-level thresholds of wildlife response to retained structures, and the lack of comparative studies that have examined responses to dispersed live tree retention. In the absence of this information, forest managers are encouraged to employ a variable range of stand-level structural retention practices in a mix of configurations.","Biodiversity; Coarse woody debris; Green tree retention; Landscape management; Old-growth forests; Snags; Structural retention; Sustainable forestry.",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349459508

Here, we characterized old-growth stands of Valdivian and North Patagonian rain forest types located in Chiloé Island (Chile, 42°30′S) using inventory data from 23 permanent plots (0.1 ha each) located in rural landscapes and protected areas of northern Chiloé Island. For each stand, its age (average age of the oldest trees present in each stand) and disturbance regimes (evidence of recent human impact, e.g. cuttings or fires, and tree growth rates) were used as defining old-growth criteria. We characterized the structure (tree species richness, size-density distributions, vertical stratification and presence of snags) and floristic composition of each stand. Environmental variables (i.e. temperature, distance to coastline and elevation) were related to stand structure using multivariate constrained correspondence analysis. Old-growth forests were commonly characterized by (a) tree basal areas &gt;80 m2/ha; (b) density of shade-tolerant tree species in the emergent and dominant canopy layer &gt;36%; (c) higher tree species richness (&gt;7 tree species) than successional stands; (d) presence of large canopy emergents (&gt;80 cm dbh, &gt;25 m tall); (e) high vertical heterogeneity; and (f) minimum stand ages older than 200 years. Old-growth forests showed a distinctive structural variability and floristic diversity influenced both by stand age and disturbance history of the stands. Structural variability was also related to environmental differences among sites (e.g. air temperature, distance to coastline, soil types). Old-growth forest features described here can offer a baseline for managers interested in maintaining and restoring old-growth forest structure in southern temperate rain forests. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Because such areas may be large, not easily accessible, subject to change, and sensitive to the surrounding landscape, remote sensing can be a valuable tool in establishing and managing protected areas. We describe three case studies to illustrate how remote sensing can contribute to setting priorities for conservation actions, monitoring the status of conservation targets, and evaluating the effectiveness of conservation strategies. In the Connecticut River watershed, remote sensing has been used to assess flood regimes and identify key areas of floodplain forests and their context for conservation planning. At Eglin Air Force Base in Florida, remote sensing has provided information to assess the effectiveness of management strategies to restore fire to the longleaf pine sandhills ecosystem, control invasive species, and prioritize annual prescribed burns. In eastern US forests, remote sensing is being used to evaluate the ecological condition and changes at properties where direct access would be difficult. As the resolution and capacities of remote-sensing technology continue to develop, however, several issues are becoming increasingly important. It is essential that the spatial and temporal resolution of remote-sensing data be matched to the relevant scales of biodiversity, major threats, and management actions. Data layers must be compatible, both in scale and in measurement properties, and key patterns must be distinguished from irrelevant detail, especially at the finer scales of application in local management. Combining remote sensing with ground surveys can expand the array of information used in management and contribute to the ecological interpretation of remote-sensing data. Because conservation funds are always limited, remote sensing also must be cost effective. This requires balancing the wealth of detail afforded by ever-finer resolution of remote-sensing data with what is actually needed to implement sound conservation and management. Remote sensing is a valuable tool, but it is not a panacea for all of the challenges of conservation monitoring and management.","Connecticut River; Conservation; Ecological monitoring; Eglin Air Force Base; Forest management; Remote sensing",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-67349210688

Given its high abundance in recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time. Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success declined from 84% the first year after fire to 73% and 25%, respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests. Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests. Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature and over-mature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated species. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Identifying the impacts of prescribed fire on bird communities in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests is necessary for providing land management agencies with information regarding the effects of fuel reduction on sensitive, threatened, and migratory bird species. Recent developments in occupancy modeling have established a framework for quantifying the impacts of management practices on wildlife community dynamics. We describe a Bayesian hierarchical model of multi-species occupancy accounting for detection probability, and we demonstrate the model's usefulness for identifying effects of habitat disturbances on wildlife communities. Advantages to using the model include the ability to estimate the effects of environmental impacts on rare or elusive species, the intuitive nature of the modeling, the incorporation of detection probability, the estimation of parameter uncertainty, the flexibility of the model to suit a variety of experimental designs, and the composite estimate of the response that applies to the collection of observed species as opposed to merely a small subset of common species. Our modeling of the impacts of prescribed fire on avian communities in a ponderosa pine forest in Washington indicate that prescribed fire treatments result in increased occupancy rates for several bark-insectivore, cavity-nesting species including a management species of interest, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus). Three aerial insectivore species, and the ground insectivore, American Robin (Turdus migratorius), also responded positively to prescribed fire, whereas three foliage insectivores and two seed specialists, Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), declined following treatments. Land management agencies interested in determining the effects of habitat manipulations on wildlife communities can use these methods to provide guidance for future management activities. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","Composite analysis; Fuel treatments; Hierarchical Bayes; Point count survey; Ponderosa pine; Presence-absence data; Species richness; WinBUGS",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68149147597

Mid-rotation pine plantations often have a substantial hardwood mid-story that limits growth of desirable understory forage species important to white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus; deer). We treated with imazapyr herbicide and prescribed burning (HB) 11 thinned, 1322-year-old loblolly pine (P. taeda) plantations in the Upper Coastal Plain (UCP; n 5) and the Lower Coastal Plain (LCP; n 6) of Mississippi, USA, enrolled in cost-share programs. We then sampled these plantations for production of important deer forages during July of 2003 and 2004, years 1 and 2 posttreatment. Deer foraging habitat was clearly improved by the HB treatment in both regions by year 2. Forb species of annual importance to deer increased in percent cover and biomass in the UCP and in biomass in the LCP. We estimated nutritional carrying capacity using a target diet quality of 14 crude protein; estimates in HB plots were 3 times greater than controls in the UCP and 19 times greater in the LCP. Although UCP sites had baseline carrying capacities nearly 8 times greater than LCP sites, the greater relative response to HB in the LCP eliminated the regional difference. Our results indicate that imazapyr herbicide treatment followed by prescribed fire is a beneficial tool for deer management in mid-rotation pine plantations.","Cost-share; Herbicide; Nutritional carrying capacity; Odocoileus virginianus; Pine plantation; Prescribed fire; White-tailed deer forage",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-73449121483

However, little is known about the quantitative responses of bird communities to postfire forest management in this region, in which the logging of burnt trees is a common practice. Several studies have already described the negative effects of felling burnt trees on birds but none has focussed on the remaining wood remnants. We investigated this question in a large burnt area located in north-east Iberian Peninsula. The amount of logging remnants left on the ground had positive linear and negative quadratic relationships with the indices of bird abundance and bird richness. The results obtained at a species level were similar, since 36% of the most abundant species revealed the same type of relations with logging remnants, whereas none showed an opposite pattern. Thus, birds in general seem to be positively influenced by the amount of wood remnants left on the ground to a certain point, from which the relation reverses. The results of this study indicate that a moderate amount of wood remnants left on the ground may be positive for the overall bird community. We suggest that management plays a role in the recovery of the bird community after fire and, therefore, biodiversity criteria should be incorporated in the guidelines driving postfire actions. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.","Avian diversity; Burnt areas; Forestry; Logging remnants; Mediterranean landscapes",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70350622185

While many studies provide useful insight, knowledge of stand-scale postfire residual occurrence and variability remains fragmented and untested as formal hypotheses. We examined the spatial variability of stand-scale postfire residuals in boreal forests and tested hypotheses of their spatial associations. Based on the literature, we hypothesized that preburn forest cover characteristics, site conditions, proximity to water and fire edge, and local fire intensity influence the spatial variability of postfire residuals. To test these hypotheses, we studied live-tree and snag residuals in 1.1 boreal Ontario forest fires, using 660 sample points based on high resolution photography (1:408) captured immediately after the fires. The abundance of residuals varied considerably within and among these fires, precluding attempts to generalize estimates. Based on a linear mixed-effects model, our data did not support the hypotheses that preburn forest cover characteristics, site conditions, and proximity to water significantly affect the spatial variability of stand-scale residuals. The results do indicate, however, that stand-scale residual variability is associated with local fire intensity (strongly) and distance to fire edge (weakly).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-66249120324

Ants were censused using 240 pitfall traps with one preburn and two postburn samples (14 d and 1 yr after burning). We analyzed ant abundance using broadly defined groups based on feeding habit and/or habitat use and detected no grazing effect but a significant fire effect that differed by group. Immediate postfire sampling showed an increase in cryptic species (particularly Brachymyrmex depilis). One year after die fire, no response was detected for cryptic species, but burned plots had greater abundance of seed harvesters. Analysis of vegetation showed burned plots had significantly greater forb cover, which might have provided greater food resources, and also lower biomass, which might have facilitated foraging.

We observed few site-level differences in pre- and posttreatment density, and no species responded strongly to treatment on all four sites. Pointlevel spatial models of individual species response to treatment, habitat variables, and fire severity revealed ecological relationships that were more easily interpreted. At this scale, pretreatment forest structure and patch characteristics were important predictors of posttreatment differences in bird species density. Five species (Pygmy Nuthatch [Sitta pygmaea], Western Bluebird [Sialia mexicana], Steller's Jay [Cyanocitta stelleri ], American Robin [Turdus migratorius], and Hairy Woodpecker [Picoides villosus]) exhibited a strong treatment response, and two of these species (American Robin and Hairy Woodpecker) could be associated with meaningful fire severity response functions. The avifaunal response patterns that we observed were not always consistent with those reported by more common studies of wildland fire events. Our results suggest that, in the short term, the distribution and abundance of common members of the breeding bird community in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests appear to be tolerant of low- to moderate-intensity prescribed fire treatments at multiple spatial scales and across multiple geographic locations. © 2009 by the Ecological Society of America.","BACI design; Birds; Density; Distance sampling; Fire severity; Forest structure; Fuel reduction treatments; Model selection; Ponderosa pine; Prescribed fire; Restoration; Scale",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-65349099353

In light of climate change and the effects of fire exclusion, single and repeated high-severity (stand-replacement) fires have become prominent land management issues. We studied bird communities using point counting in the Klamath-Siskiyou ecoregion of Oregon, USA at various points in time after one or two high-severity fires. Time points included 2 and 3 years after a single fire, 17 and 18 years after a single fire, 2 and 3 years after a repeat fire (15 year interval between fires), and >100 years since stand-replacement fire (mature/old-growth forest). Avian species richness did not differ significantly among habitats. Bird density was highest 17 and 18 years after fire, lowest 2 years after fire, and intermediate in repeat burns and unburned forest. Bird community composition varied significantly with habitat type (A = 0.24, P < 0.0001) with two distinct gradients in species composition relating to tree structure (live to dead) and shrub stature. Using indicator species analysis, repeat burns were characterized by shrub-nesting and ground-foraging bird species while unburned mature forests were characterized by conifer-nesting and foliage-gleaning species. Bird density was not related to snag basal area but was positively related to shrub height. Contrary to expectations, repeated high-severity fire did not reduce species richness, and bird densities were greater in repeat burns than in once-burned habitats. Broad-leaved hardwoods and shrubs appear to play a major role in structuring avian communities in the Klamath-Siskiyou region. In light of these results, extended periods of early seral broadleaf dominance and short-interval high-severity fires may be important to the conservation of avian biodiversity. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.","Avian; Biscuit Fire; Klamath-Siskiyou; Mediterranean; Mixed severity; Reburn",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-59749098451

We dip-netted for larval salamanders from January through March 20032006 and we measured a suite of vegetation characteristics in 20062007. Further, in 2006 we measured the level of water and relative presence of fish over the salamander breeding season.

In this study we determine the most cost-efficient conservation management options for the white-banded tanager (Neothraupis fasciata) in the protected areas of the Cerrado in central Brazil. We use the PVA model VORTEX to simulate the ability of different management options to improve population persistence and then assess the effectiveness of each option given a fixed budget. We discover that the best strategy for improving the viability of white-banded tanager populations is to use fire management and nest protection to increase fecundity. In small reserves and a low budget then fire management alone is the best strategy, but if the budget is larger fire management with nest protection as a mixed strategy is better. In large reserves the best strategy is to do nest protection and with large budgets there is a negligible difference between spending all the money on nest protection versus a mixed strategy. If we had not included financial considerations in our analysis of management options then we would have discarded fire management as an option, even though it can be the best strategy. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Its habitat, Corsican pine Pinus nigra laricio forest, is currently restricted to less than 16,000 ha and is threatened by forest fires. In this article, we aim (1) to evaluate the effects of a large wildfire on a Nuthatch population, and (2) to identify the habitat features that influence the presence/absence of the Nuthatch after fire, so as to promote appropriate forestry practices after fire. The study has been conducted on a study plot of 300 ha which is part of a larger area severely burnt in August 2003. Habitat characteristics have been investigated on 39 plots of 1,225 m2 occupied by the bird, and 22 randomly chosen plots without the Nuthatch. We observed a decrease of 37.5% in Nuthatch abundance the first spring after the fire, but the impact showed great local variation as a function of fire severity. Logistic modelling showed that the presence of Nuthatch mainly depended on the degree of crown alteration: the Nuthatch tended to be present when at least one pine had less than 2.5 m of crown burned. We have no evidence of any direct fire-induced mortality, but several effects of fire can explain this population decrease, namely, the reduction of canopy volume, the decrease of the amount of pine seeds, and the reduction of nest-site availability. These results permit us to propose a simple criterion that can help in choosing the plots to be cut where salvage logging is necessary. © Dt.

Few studies, however, have examined effects on early-seral species that may benefit from postfire logging, nor effects on trophic relationships. We studied the effects of postfire logging on trophic dynamics between wolves (Canis lupus), three ungulate species and ungulate forage biomass during the first 3 years in a large burn in the Canadian Rockies, Alberta, Canada. We examined plant biomass and ungulate responses to two treatments (post- and prefire logging) compared to a burned but unlogged area (control). We evaluated resource selection for the three treatments by elk (Cervus elaphus) using radiotelemetry and for deer (Odocoileus spp.), moose (Alces alces), and, secondarily, elk using pellet counts. Elk resource selection was modeled as a function of the trade-off between wolf predation risk and herbaceous forage biomass to test for trophic impacts of postfire treatments. Postfire logging had transient effects on total herbaceous biomass; while forb biomass was reduced, increases in graminoid biomass more than compensated by the third year. Prefire logging areas were dominated by a few species, but had generally higher forage biomass by the third year. Ungulates avoided postfire and prefire logged areas despite greater herbaceous biomass. Only when we considered elk resource selection as a function of both forage and wolf predation risk was the extent to which trophic interactions affected by postfire logging revealed. Wolves selected proximity to roads and the higher forage biomass associated with postfire logging in open logged areas. This translated to the highest predation risk for elk in postfire logged areas. Thus, ungulates avoided postfire logged areas because of human alteration of top-down predation risk despite enhancements to bottom-up forage biomass. Managers should consider trophic consequences of postfire logging on the interactions among species when gauging logging effects on terrestrial ecosystems. Making use of existing roads, minimizing the construction of new roads, and managing road removal following postfire logging will help mitigate the negative effects of postfire logging on terrestrial ecosystems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The impacts of postfire management, including salvage logging and replanting, on these forests are not well known. We compared densities and relative abundances of forest birds after fire in unsalvaged stands and stands subjected to one of two intensities of salvage logging (moderate, 30 snags retained per ha and heavy, 5-6 snags retained per ha) in mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon. We used analysis of variance with repeated measures to evaluate three hypotheses concerning the influence of different intensities of salvage on densities or relative abundances of sixteen species of birds, and two hypotheses concerning the influence of time since salvage logging on relative abundances or densities of birds. We also examined the relationship between vegetation and abundances of each bird species. We did not detect significant differences among treatments in densities or relative abundances for eight species and one genus of birds. We detected significant differences for seven species, though the patterns differed among species. Relative abundances or densities of the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), hairy woodpecker (P. villosus), brown creeper (Certhia americana), western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) were lower in the heavy and moderate salvage treatment compared to the unsalvaged treatment, while densities of the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) were greater in the moderately and heavily salvaged stands than in the unsalvaged treatment. We detected significant differences between years for four species of birds. Our findings suggest that both cavity-nesting and cup-nesting species respond to salvage logging, and that some species respond uniquely to habitat features influenced by salvage logging. For species that responded negatively to salvage logging, the moderate salvage intensity did not appear to mitigate the negative influence of salvage logging. Areas of unlogged burned forest appear to provide important habitat for some species of birds following forest fires. Our findings parallel those of other recent studies of these species, suggesting robust patterns that transcend particular locations. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To what extent have past disturbances (natural and anthropogenic) influenced the development of old-growth characteristics of these forests? How long does it take for selectively cut stands to attain conditions resembling old-growth forests? Location: Southern boreal zone of central Sweden. Methods: We linked multiple lines of evidence from historical records, biological archives, and analyses of current forest structure to reconstruct the forest history of a boreal landscape, with special emphasis on six remaining core localities of high-conservation value forest stands. Results: Our reconstructions revealed that several of these stands experienced wildfires up to the 1890s; all had been selectively harvested in the late 1800s; and all underwent substantial structural and compositional reorganization over the following 100-150 years. This time interval was sufficient to recover considerable amounts of standing and downed dead wood (mean 60.3 m3ha-1), a range of tree ages and sizes (mean basal area 32.6 m2 ha-1), and dominance of shade-tolerant spruce. It was insufficient to obtain clearly uneven tree age structures and large (&gt;45cm diameter) living and dead trees. Thus, these forests contain some, but not all, important compositional and structural attributes of old-growth forests, their abundance being dependent on the timing and magnitude of past natural and anthropogenic disturbances. Our landscape-level analysis showed marked compositional and structural differences between the historical forest landscape and the present landscape, with the latter having a greater proportion of young forests, introduction of nonnative species, and lack of large trees and dead wood. Conclusions: The remnant high-conservation value stands were not true representatives of the pre-industrial forests, but represent the last vestige of forests that have regenerated naturally and maintained a continuous tree cover. These traits, coupled with their capacity for old-growth recovery, make them valuable focal areas for conservation. © 2009 International Association for Vegetation Science.","Coarse woody debris; Dendrochronology; Fire ecology; Historical records; Land-use history; Picea abies; Southern boreal zone; Stand dynamics; Stand reconstruction; Sweden; Woodland key habitats",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70249110379

Typically, emphasis is on pattern emulation, and less on processes, such as competition, predation or habitat selection. Knowing how communities in the boreal forest assemble can provide further insight to the effects of anthropogenic disturbance on the processes responsible, permitting assessments about whether forestry practices emulate processes as well as patterns. We contrasted variation in species richness among forest types, with stand area, and between local (forest stand) and regional (landscape) scales on managed and natural boreal landscapes in NW Ontario. Species richness varied more among forest stand types than between landscapes, or with stand area, on either landscape. On both landscapes, mean local species richness was 1/3 of regional richness, consistent with the hypothesis that competition structured stand-level assemblages regardless of stand origin. We further compared the structure of stand-level assemblages from randomized null models using presence/absence and abundance data with observed assemblages on each landscape, while controlling for variation in habitat structure among stands. Local bird assemblages were over-dispersed in niche space relative to random assemblages, also consistent with the competition hypothesis, regardless of stand origin. We found no evidence that patterns of variation in diversity of songbirds and woodpeckers, nor the processes that govern them, differed between managed and natural boreal forest landscapes. Our results suggest that past forest practices in this region, if by default, nevertheless emulated natural patterns of variation in diversity and species assembly of bird communities.","Boreal forest; Community assembly; Forestry; Natural disturbance emulation; Null models; Ontario; Songbirds; Woodpeckers",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65649094762

We used conspecific recordings in conjunction with point counts to assess relationships between winter sparrow abundance and use of prescribed fire. Counts of sparrows conducted over three winters were higher (0.59 ± 0.42) (x̄ ± SD) when surrounding vegetation was burned the previous breeding season than in areas burned >18 months earlier (0.27 ± 0.38). Year-to-year abundance estimates for individual stations increased an average of 0.39 (± 0.54) individuals per count when surrounding vegetation was burned the previous breeding season and decreased 0.22 (± 0.59) individuals per count when vegetation was not burned. Sparrow counts were positively correlated with percent bare ground cover surrounding census stations and negatively correlated with increases in percent grass cover, grass standing crop, height of grass, and shrubs <1 m in height. Prescribed fire may improve winter foraging conditions for this ground-dwelling species by reducing dense grass cover at ground level.

Guadalajara, Jalisco, C.P. 44660, Mexico","Since it is difficult to describe all physical characteristics for all fuels in a forest, the concept of ""fuel model"" is used, which is a generalized description (set of numerical values) of fuel properties. Fuel models also represent a measure of expected fire behavior; therefore they are used to support fire behavior simulations. For that reason, the current tendency of fuel mapping is to classify, a given forest, into the corresponding fuel models, mainly through indirect approaches. However, fuel loadings are not always spatially constant; consequently it is possible to have spatial variations of fire behavior within a forest classified as a given fuelmodel. Therefore, the most accurate way for mapping forest fuels is from the evaluation of actual conditions directly inventoried or recognized on the ground. Since the cost and the amount of labor needed for this type of fuel mapping could make its use impractical, an alternative approach is shown based on geostatistics strategies. Using the resulting maps (1-hr, 10-hrs, 100-hrs, and live woody), a spatial simulation model (SSM) was developed, to determine the size, shape, and geographical location of fire behavior, based on spatial variations of fuel loads. In SSM fire behavior is simulated on a locational basis, where individual spatial units (with predetermined location) describe reality. This simulation is performed deterministically, and under the raster perspective, because this allowed working with point specified changes of fuels loading. The performance of SSM was compared with FARSITE, under the same environmental conditions (fuel moisture, wind and topography). In this sense, simulation with SSM was supported by the forest fuel maps, while FARSITE simulation was based on the fuel model map. This comparison showed notable differences in fire behavior (rate of spread, heat per unit area, fireline intensity, flame length, reaction intensity, and flame depth). Therefore, although the fuel model concept is useful in many cases, its use should be limited to general predictions of fire behavior to support fire management strategies in large areas. This approach would be useful in areas where vegetation and fuels are spatially homogeneous; however, in practice this condition is not frequent. Then, fuel loading mapping is an alternative to define fire behavior at a larger scale. This is because, in many cases, fuel models do not reflect the actual spatial variability of fuels' characteristics. Finally, factors such as the ""chimney effect"", ""vortex"" phenomena occurring within a burning area, heat transfer (by convection and radiation) to unburned areas, and detection of changes in the surface-area-volume ratio, are only some factors that need to be considered in further forest fuel mapping approaches that support fire behavior simulation. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,Book Chapter,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84895381017

Because fire and harvesting compete directly for the same wood supply, and provinces have, within the last few decades, tended to reach their annual allowable cut, salvage logging has emerged as a practice to minimize the impact of fire on long-term wood supply. In most parts of the boreal and cordilleran forests, fire-killed boles rapidly degrade after their death, as wood-boring insects, stain, wood-decay fungi and checking lead to significant loss of grade or volume in the months following the fire. Because of this impending degradation, salvage operations are often hurried and other considerations, including the potential ecological impacts of salvage logging, have seldom been taken into consideration when defining harvesting strategies. The ecological consequences of rapid salvage have been widely studied only in the last 5 years, and it is now clear that salvage logging can have negative impacts on natural regeneration by seed, water quality, and fire-associated animal species. In this paper, we review both industrial and ecological constraints to salvage logging and discuss how both can be integrated in salvage plans. In particular, we focus on the issues of salvage timing and retention. At this point, some type of retention of merchantable stands, even if only for a few years, appears to be the only way to alleviate the negative ecological impacts of post-fire logging. On-site operational constraints, e.g., stands that cannot be harvested due to lack of accessibility, represent an important starting point for any retention strategy.","Biodiversity; Boreal forest; Forest fires; Natural disturbances; Regeneration after fire; Salvage logging",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-65649096146

Genetic samples from eighteen subspecies of all currently accepted crest and kinglet species were available for comparison. In all molecular tree reconstructions it was clearly apparent the Taiwan endemic species was the sister species of all the palearctic Goldcrests (Regulus regulus) from Bayesian inference of phylogeny, although with weak bootstrap support and conflicting position in the ML and NJ trees. Genetic distances based on cyt-b sequences between R. goodfellowi and subspecies of R. regulus ranged between 6.1 and 8.2%. Two separate divergence time estimates dated the colonization of Taiwan to the mid to late Pliocene from 5-2 Mya. The high-pitched territorial songs of R. goodfellowi strongly resemble those of Sino-Himalayan Goldcrests (ssp. himalayensis, sikkimensis, and yunnanensis), but the terminal flourish typical of Goldcrests is invariable and only rarely included in songs of R. goodfellowi. Discriminant analysis of spectral and temporal characteristics separated the songs of the Southeast Asian populations from those of two other large clusters, the Canarian and Northwest Palearctic. Songs of R. goodfellowi were 100% correctly assigned and well distinguishable from Sino-Himalayan songs. Cluster analysis of Regulus songs strongly corroborated the sister group relationship of R. goodfellowi and R. regulus as reconstructed from concatenated mitochondrial sequence data.

Reuse of sites by the same individual was common (32.3%), but use of the same site by different individuals was rare, as was communal use of sites (<1.0% each). Contrasting used and putatively available dens and resting sites, we found that sites were selected based primarily on increased vegetative cover, which supports hypotheses that thermal regulation and predator avoidance may underlie den and resting site selection. Higher rock and vine densities, younger pine forest stands, older hardwood stands, steeper slope, and smaller site entrance also positively influenced resting and den site selection. These findings suggest that eastern spotted skunks select structurally complex sites, likely to enhance protection from predators.

Specifically, such forests are said to carry higher fuel loads and experience fires that are more severe than those that occurred historically. It remains unclear, however, how far these generalizations can be extrapolated in time and space, and how well they apply to the more mesic ponderosa pine systems and to other forest systems within the western United States. I use data on the pattern of distribution of one bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) as derived from 16 465 sample locations to show that, in western Montana, this bird species is extremely specialized on severely burned forests. Such specialization has profound implications because it suggests that the severe fires we see burning in many forests in the Intermountain West are not entirely ""unnatural"" or ""unhealthy."" Instead, severely burned forest conditions have probably occurred naturally across a broad range of forest types for millennia.

Predicting the response of biota to disturbance is therefore important, but it nevertheless remains difficult to make accurate forecasts of response. We tested predictions from disturbance-related theories and concepts in 10 vegetation types at Booderee National Park (southeastern Australia) using a retrospective study of bird responses to fire history (over 35 years) on 110 sites and a prospective study following a single wildfire event in 2003 at 59 of these sites. Our data did not support predictions from the intermediate-disturbance hypothesis; observed bird species richness at a site was significantly (F1,99 = 6.30, P = 0.014) negatively related to the number of fires since 1972 and was 8.7% lower (95% CI, 1.8-15.1%) for each additional fire. In contrast to fire history effects, we found that after the 2003 fire, the vast majority of individual species and the bird assemblage per se in most vegetation types recovered within two years. Thus, recovery after a single fire did not reflect long-term effects of multiple fires on overall bird species richness at a site. We postulated that the recovery of bird species richness and bird assemblage composition after the 2003 fire would be fastest in structurally simple vegetation types and slowest in structurally complex vegetation, but observed the opposite. Although observed bird species richness in vertically heterogeneous forest and woodland had returned to prefire levels by 2006, bird species richness in structurally simple vegetation types (e.g., sedgeland) had not. Postfire vegetation regeneration, together with a paucity of early-successional specialists, would explain the speed of recovery of the bird assemblage and why it changed relatively little during our investigation. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Avifauna; Biological legacies; Bird community; Disturbance; Fire history; Fire severity; Sedgeland; Southeastern Australia; Vegetation management; Wildfire event",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63249103941

These disturbances produced synchronous fluctuations in forest characteristics over large spatial scales. In this paper, we review possible responses of flora and fauna to pulsed large-scale disturbance events and speculate on whether they should be emulated to reduce the impacts of forest management on non-timber resources. The importance of large-scale disturbance pulses for biodiversity and forest ecosystem integrity is potentially great, but this aspect has been poorly investigated by previous research, and thus there is little information available to guide forest management. Large-scale, synchronous disturbances could be emulated by clustering harvesting activities in time, for example by creating ""harvest pulses"" of 10-20 years, separated by periods of 50-100 years or so with low harvest rates. A potential disadvantage of this strategy is that when our capacity to predict future natural disturbances is low, there is a higher probability of accidentally taking the forest ecosystem outside of the range of natural variability compared with a status quo forest management scenario. From a socio-economic perspective, another potential disadvantage is in creating irregular wood flows to the forest transformation industry. Nonetheless, in a context where the forest has been over-disturbed in the recent past, a forest management strategy involving fluctuating harvest rates could provide the means for faster ecosystem recovery compared with a status quo strategy. We recommend that the potential importance of disturbance pulses for boreal and sub-boreal ecosystems be more thoroughly investigated by future research to inform management and conservation policies. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

However, most research has focused on avian use of cavities in the breeding season, with little attention given to other cavity using guilds or cavity use during the non-breeding season. Furthermore, most breeding season studies were in unburned forests containing a mix of conifer and deciduous trees with much less attention given to cavity rich post-burn habitats. The objective of this study was to examine cavity use during the breeding and non-breeding seasons in old-burned ponderosa pine forests in the Black Hills, South Dakota. One hundred seventy nine active cavity nests of nine cavity nesting species were monitored between 2002-2005. We examined the contents of each cavity during the breeding season and twice during each non-breeding season (fall, winter, spring) each year. Additionally, we conducted vegetative surveys to determine the microhabitat variables that might influence the occupancy of cavities in the breeding season. Binomial logistic regression with AIC model selection criteria were used to model breeding season cavity reuse for the three most common cavity excavator species, Lewis's Woodpeckers (Melanerpes lewis), Red-headed Woodpeckers (M. erythrocephalus) and Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus). All three species reused old cavities most recently used by conspecifics for breeding; snag density (dbh > 23 cm) and cavity height consistently influenced reuse of cavities for all three species. In the non-breeding season the cavities of these same three species were all commonly used, but Northern Flicker cavities contained the greatest diversity of secondary cavity users. We speculate that Northern Flicker cavities may have been used more frequently in the non-breeding season because of their lower cavity height compared to other similar sized cavities.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-54949090396

We examined the foraging sites of 13 species of ground-foraging birds, including four common species and nine declining species, in four study areas representing different woodland types. Microhabitat features were recorded within a 3-m radius of observed foraging points and compared with random points. Significant differences between foraging and random plots were detected for all but one species, clearly indicating selection for foraging habitat. However, levels of dissimilarity between foraging and random plots were low, suggesting that much of the woodland study area is suitable for foraging. Microhabitat features of particular importance for multiple species were a low density of trees and shrubs, a high cover of native herbs, and fallen timber on the ground. Sites amidst dense trees tended not to be used. Several species had more particular requirements, such as the Diamond Firetail (Stagonopleura guttata) for grass cover and the White-winged Chough (Corcorax melanorhamphos) for litter cover. There was no evidence that declining species showed a greater degree of selection or were more restricted in the availability of foraging microhabitats than common species. Several of the key attributes of preferred foraging sites, such as tree density, can be actively managed at the local scale. A heterogeneous ground layer is needed to provide suitable foraging habitat for the full suite of ground-foraging birds. Achieving suitable heterogeneity in present-day woodlands will require careful and active management of various disturbance processes. © Royal Australasian Ornithologists Union 2008.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-51349144116

However, it also has impacts on nongame species. We examined whether a prescribed fire would affect the abundance of lizards and invertebrates in central Texas. In February 2004, four sites were treated with low-intensity prescribed fires; four adjacent non-burned sites served as controls. Vegetation structure (litter depth, percent canopy cover, visual obstruction) and foliar cover were recorded prior to and seasonally following the burn. Lizards and potential invertebrate prey were collected from all plots between March and August 2004 (152 traps, 5908 trap nights). Lizard numbers were not significantly (P > 0.312) affected by the fire, nor were their potential prey or habitat greatly affected. Burning reduced numbers of Homoptera (P < 0.031), and Diptera were more abundant in burned plots in May (P < 0.002), but no other effects were detected (P <0.05 for all other taxa). Burning did not affect vegetation structure (P > 0.25 for all measures); however, foliar cover of Texas wintergrass was lower in burned plots in March but recovered to non-burned levels by May. Our results suggest that small-scale, low-intensity fires have minimal impact on central Texas lizards, the vegetation structure of their habitat, or the invertebrates of their diet. © 2008 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.","Invertebrates; Lizards; Prescribed fire; Short-term effects; Vegetation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-70349165430

This article describes the ecological risk assessment for the missile launch and detonation. The primary stressor associated with this activity was sound. Other minor stressors included the detonation impact, shrapnel, and fire. Exposure to desert mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus crooki) was quantified using the Army sound contour program BNOISE2, as well as distances from the explosion to deer. Few effects data were available from related studies. Exposure-response models for the characterization of effects consisted of human ""disturbance"" and hearing damage thresholds in units of C-weighted decibels (sound exposure level) and a distance-based No-Observed-Adverse-Effects Level for moose and cannonfire. The risk characterization used a weight-of-evidence approach and concluded that risk to mule deer behavior from the missile firing was likely for a negligible number of deer, but that no risk to mule deer abundance and reproduction is expected.

These declines are partially attributable to large-scale conversions of potential habitat to short-rotation pine (Pinus spp.) forests managed for wood fiber production and fire exclusion in pine-dominated landscapes. We used standard arthropod sampling techniques, human-imprinted bobwhite chicks, and vegetation response to evaluate effects of different understory vegetation management practices on brood habitat quality within a commercially managed pine forest in Louisiana, USA, during 2002-2005. Specifically, we evaluated effects of mowing, prescribed fire during the growing season, prescribed fire in combination with imazapyr application, and no vegetation management on arthropod abundance and diversity, vegetation response, and the probability of bobwhite chicks successfully capturing an arthropod. Bobwhite chicks were more successful at capturing arthropods, and arthropod abundance and diversity were greatest, in plant communities managed using prescribed fire and imazapyr. Forest stands managed using a combination of fire and imazapyr were managed primarily to benefit the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis; RCW). Our findings suggest that management directed toward improving forest condition for RCWs improves habitat quality for brooding bobwhites. However, bobwhite chicks in our study area were less successful at capturing arthropods than were chicks in other studies in the southeastern United States. Brood-rearing habitat in pine forests similar to those we studied may be of generally poor quality, and could be related to precipitous declines of bobwhites in the West Gulf Coastal Plain. Managers should recognize that creating high-quality brood habitat in forests similar to those we studied will require more intensive management of understory vegetation than we studied.","Arthropods; Brood habitat; Colinus virginianus; Imazapyr; Imprinting; Louisiana; Northern bobwhite; Prescribed fire; Red-cockaded woodpecker",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-50249156832

To date, this paradigm has been evaluated primarily at the stand level and within conventional harvesting systems. The potential for improvements in avian conservation at the landscape scale by adopting the NDP approach is largely unknown. We examined the effects of landscape-scale disturbances on forest bird communities by contrasting richness and abundance of birds in (1) 16 single-pass harvest sites with residual forest patches, (2) 29 multi-pass harvest sites with residuals; and (3) 15 salvage-logged post-fire sites with variable harvest intensity. We contrasted bird communities in these treatments with those in unsalvaged post-fire sites of similar age. Post-fire sites were used to provide a metric of the Natural Range of Variation (NRV) to be expected in bird communities. Sites were surveyed for avian community composition and abundance 1-5 years post-disturbance. Redundancy analysis indicated that bird communities differed from the NRV in all of the harvest treatments. However, single-pass harvests provided a somewhat better fit to NRV than did multi-pass harvesting. Avian community similarity was influenced by non-linear responses to area harvested, amount of residual retention, residual composition and pre-disturbance forest composition. An optimization routine created from a General Linear Model, suggests that community similarity to NRV can be maximized by using single-pass harvests over multi-pass harvests, harvesting 66-88% of the timber in the planning unit, and retaining 5-19% of the disturbance area as live residual patches, with 50% of harvests having at least 9% of the area in residuals.

Centre-Ville, Montréal, QC H3C 3P8, Canada","Several boreal insect species respond to smoke and heat generated by forest fires and use recent burns to reproduce in high numbers. Some of these species are rare or uncommon in undisturbed forests, and the contribution of recently burned habitats to their population dynamics has been deemed crucial by some to their long-term persistence. Consequently, the severe decline seen in some species in Fennoscandia has been frequently linked with fire suppression. In this paper, we explore some aspects of the spatial dynamics of pyrophilous insect populations in relation to the expected relative contribution of burned and unburned habitats to their global population dynamics. Forest fires are, throughout the boreal forest biome, generally highly aggregated in some years while rare in most other years. The low connectivity between fire events and the typical life cycle seen in these species make it improbable that recent burns act as significant population sources. This leads us to suggest that populations of pyrophilous species may be more limited by the adequacy of the unburned matrix than by the occurrence of fire events. Moreover, by combining an age-class distribution model and a dead wood availability model, we show that the quality of the unburned matrix increases in landscapes with longer fire cycles, in which pyrophilous insects should persist at higher population levels. We conclude that the degradation of the unburned habitat better explains the decline of pyrophilous insects than fire suppression alone. © 2007 The Authors.","Boreal forest; Forest fire; Habitat connectivity; Population dynamics; Pyrophilous insects",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44949131686

If hollow occurrence varies with forest type, the use of generic prescriptions for managing the hollow resource may be inappropriate. This study examined the relationship between the occurrence and abundance of tree hollows and site and tree attributes in wet and dry Eucalyptus obliqua forest in Tasmania, Australia. A total of 388 trees at 39 sites were examined before and after being felled. Evidence of invertebrate damage contributing to hollow formation was more common in wet forest than either dry or damp forest. Evidence of hollow formation by fire and fungi was more prevalent in drier than wetter forest. There was no difference among forest types in the proportion of hollows showing evidence of limb breakage. Examination of the site and tree factors related to hollow presence and abundance was done using Classification Trees, Random Forests and generalised linear models. The variables found to be most practical for predicting hollow occurrence were the number of hollows observed before the tree was felled, tree diameter and the amount of dead wood in the canopy. Tree age, an important variable to consider when planning harvest rotations, was strongly associated with hollow presence but had less bearing on hollow abundance. The size of hollows that were found in a tree was related to greater senescence. Although significantly more hollows of all sizes were found in wet forest than either dry or damp forest, the age at which trees began to produce hollows was similar among the different forest types. The models predicted that trees needed to be at least 100 years old before they are likely to contain a hollow and that medium-sized hollows rarely occur in trees younger than 140 years old. Trees grow slightly more slowly in dry forest than wet which means that smaller diameter trees were found to contain hollows in dry forest than wet and that even the largest trees may not contain large hollows in wet forest.

However, the effects of restoration practices are difficult to measure, and restoration goals often are unclear. Landscape modeling provides a tool for evaluating outcomes of various management scenarios and restoration strategies. In this article, we provide a framework for using landscape models for forest restoration. Specifically, we present a case study usin LANDIS, a landscape simulation model of forest disturbance and succession, to explore the effects of restoration strategies for forests damaged by southern pine beetle in the southern Appalachians. Our research suggests that landscape models are valuable tools in the forest restoration decisionmaking process. Future work on landscape models for forest restoration and other related issues is discussed.

Lightning also impacts this system on a smaller scale by causing individual tree mortality. The objective of this study was to determine mortality due to lightning and other agents in longleaf stands on the Ocala National Forest in central Florida and to quantify lightning ignited fire. Mortality from lightning was also tracked in longleaf stands on the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. Lightning killed more trees than any other agent with a mean mortality of nearly 1 tree/3 ha/yr in Florida and 1 tree/8 ha/yr in South Carolina. The probability of a tree being struck by lightning increased as a function of tree height at both sites, i.e. lightning preferentially removed the largest trees from the stand. In addition lightning strikes were clumped within stands, sometimes killed multiple trees with a single strike, and often hit trees on the edge of existing gaps. The combination of these processes means gaps suitable for regeneration within longleaf stands are created quite rapidly. This information provides guidelines for the development of selection harvest systems based on this natural disturbance. Although lightning activity was greatest during the summer months in Florida and most fires occurred in June, the probability of a strike causing a fire was highest in February to May.","Disturbance; Mortality; Pinus palustris; Selection Silviculture; Wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049084711

In response, land managers implement fuel reduction strategies. These situations could potentially affect numerous wildlife species, including cavity-nesting birds. Much information exists on nesting requirements of cavity-nesters, while little information is available on their foraging requirements, or how changes to their habitat affect foraging. We examined short-term responses of cavity-nesting birds in dry conifer forests of Washington, to fuel reduction treatments in 2004 and 2005, as part of the National Fire-Fire Surrogate Project (FFS). Our objective was to determine if altering the forest stand through mechanical thinning or prescribed burning or a combination of the two would alter foraging tree selection. We used linear logistic regression and Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) to model foraging tree selection and to analyze the effects of treatments on foraging tree selection. Model averaged parameter estimates suggested that cavity-nesting birds selected for large diameter trees and FFS treatments had a positive impact on foraging for nuthatches and woodpeckers. Birds were more likely to be observed foraging in treated stands and the positive relationship was strongest in stands that received a combination of thinning and burning treatments. Enhanced foraging conditions in the thin-burn treatment may have resulted from a more complete removal of small trees, while the prescribed burn was so low-intensity, it did not remove many small trees. Bird groups selected for trees at least 1.6 times as large in diameter in treated stands as compared to control stands. Our results indicate activities such as thinning and burning may best enhance foraging habitat for bark gleaning species as a whole. Our data suggests that some important treatment design considerations include the removal of small trees and the retention of large trees and snags (>40 cm dbh) that provide important foraging substrate and nesting habitat.","Cavity-nesting bird; Fire; Fire-surrogate; Foraging; Model; Thinning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43049129554

Each silvicultural treatment was applied to two approximately 100 ha units within each of three blocks. Prescribed burning was applied to one-half of each silvicultural treatment in a split-plot design. Occupancy was estimated at eight points in each plot for 11 bird species and three foraging guilds (bark gleaners, woodpeckers, and foliage gleaners). The frequencies of species detections on the point counts were used to estimate species richness on each plot. Occupancy did not differ among treatments for any of the guilds. Four of the 11 bird species, the American robin (Turdus migratorius L., 1766), the chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina (Bechstein, 1798)), the white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis Latham, 1790), and the western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana (A. Wilson, 1811)), showed responses to the treatments. Species richness did not differ between the silvicultural or the burn treatments. The general lack of response of the bird community to the silvicultural and burn treatments is likely a result of the relatively large size of the trees and snags retained on both silvicultural treatments, the low intensity of the prescribed burns, and the lack of a strong contrast in tree density between the silvicultural treatments. © 2008 NRC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44449156781

However, little is known about how cooperation and competition varies seasonally in monogamous species that maintain permanent territories. We presented territorial pairs of male and female New Zealand robins (Petroica australis) with a large supply of insect prey at monthly intervals for 2 years. Behavioural observations after food presentation were then made to quantify seasonal and sexual differences in aggressive interactions over prey, prey acquisition rates, mate provisioning, offspring provisioning, selfish food hoarding and cache retrieval. Data were used to evaluate sex-specific behavioural strategies of mediating competition for food. Results showed that males aggressively excluded females from experimental food sources year-round. Females only accessed food sources when males left them unattended. Consequently, females acquired fewer prey than males. After controlling for differences in prey acquisition, both sexes consumed similar amounts of prey in the non-breeding season. Even though males aggressively excluded females from accessing food sources directly, males fed large amounts of prey to females during the breeding season. Both sexes provisioned young at similar rates. Males cached less prey than females in the breeding season but more prey than females in the non-breeding season. Females showed similar caching intensities year-round. Although males tried to defend their hoards, females frequently retrieved male-made caches. Overall, results showed that although New Zealand robins cooperate to raise offspring during the breeding season, conflict between the sexes occurs year-round. Males and females display different behavioural strategies to gain access to experimental food sources, which appear to lessen male-female competition for food and evenly distribute food resources between the sexes. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Cache; Monogamy; Parental care; Sexual conflict; Songbird",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-42449149461

However, non-lethal fires of moderate intensity (MIF), which leave behind surviving trees, have also been reported. The objectives of this study were two-fold: (1) assess the concurrent dynamics of live trees, understory vegetation and different types of coarse woody debris (CWD) during succession after HIF; and (2) document how MIF affects stand structure component dynamics compared to HIF. Stands affected by both HIF and MIF were selected. Tree characteristics and age structure, understory biomass, and CWD volume were assessed. Our results suggest that the structural succession of jack pine stands following HIF comprises three stages: young stands (<48 years), premature and mature stands (58-100 years) and old stands (>118 years). Canopy openness and jack pine density significantly decreased with time since HIF, while black spruce density and CWD volume significantly increased. The highest structural diversity was measured in the premature and mature stands. Compared to HIF, MIF increased mean jack pine basal area, decreased average stand density, delayed the replacement of jack pine by black spruce replacement in the canopy, decreased CWD volume, and significantly increased bryophytes mass. MIF increased the diversity of live trees and generally decreased CWD structural diversity. The study confirms the diversity of natural disturbance magnitude and successional processes thereby initiated. Thereafter, it appeared to be relevant for adjustment of disturbance emulating forest-management systems.

A 1368 ha wildfire burned across the area that autumn. The plot was resurveyed in 1977 and periodically through 2006. Before the fire, birds with the highest importance values were Blackburnian Warbler (Dendroicafusca), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus) and Bay-breasted Warbler (D. castanea). Within 7 y following the fire, canopy tree cover decreased to near zero as fire-damaged trees died. Afterwards, the canopy began increasing, reaching 53% cover by 30 y. Shrub cover, 8% before the fire, peaked at over 70% two decades after fire, primarily as a result of dense jack pine and black spruce regeneration, and then decreased to 58% 30 y after fire. The total number of bird species using the area doubled the first year following the fire while the number of bird species with discernable territories decreased 40%. Thereafter, territorial species began increasing and 30 y after the fire the number exceeded the pre-fire richness by 60%. Overall, density of bird territories decreased nearly three-fold the first 3 y after the fire, but by year 30, was over 56% greater than in the pre-burn mature pine forest. Loss of canopy was related to a reduction in warbler and vireo diversity while increases in woody debris and near-ground vegetation were related to an increase in ground-brush foragers such as White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) and Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina). Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) populations increased briefly as trees died, and for five years following fire there was an increase in woodpeckers and secondary cavity nesting species. At 7 to 10 y after fire, White-throated Sparrow, Magnolia Warbler (Dendroica magnolia), Chestnut-sided Warbler (D. pensylvanica), Nashville Warbler (Vermivora ruficapilla) and Mourning Warbler (Oporornis Philadelphia) dominated. White-throated Sparrow continued to be the most important bird species through the first two decades, followed by Magnolia Warbler and Red-eyed Vireo. Thirty years after fire, the dominant birds were Nashville Warbler and Ovenbird, followed distantly by Veery (Catharus fuscescens) Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), Least Flycatcher (Empidonax minimus) and Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia).

Two trap designs and four semiochemical attractants were tested in a recently burned ponderosa pine, Pinus ponderosa Dougl. ex Laws., forest in the Black Hills. Modified panel and funnel traps were tested in combination with the attractants, which included a woodborer standard (ethanol and α-pinene), standard plus 3-carene, standard plus ipsenol, and standard plus ipsdienol.

Location: Mature Quercus-Carya and Quercus-Carya-Pinus (oak-hickory-pine) forests in north Mississippi, USA. Methods: We used partial correlation and factor analysis to investigate relationships between native ground cover plant species richness and composition, percent cover of Lonicera japonica, and local and landscape-level environmental variables and disturbance patterns in mature upland forests. We directly measured vegetation and environmental variables within 34 sampling subplots and quantified the amount of tree cover surrounding our plots using digital color aerial photography. Results: Simple bivariate correlations revealed that high species richness and a high proportion of herbs were associated with low Lonicera japonica cover, moist and sandy uncompacted soils, low disturbance in the surrounding landscape, and periodic prescribed burning. Partial correlations and factor analysis showed that once we accounted for the environmental factors, L. japonica cover was the least important predictor of composition and among the least important predictors of species richness. Hence, much of the negative correlation between native species diversity and this invasive species was explained by soil texture and local and landscape-level land-use practices. Conclusions: We conclude that negative correlations between the abundance of invasive species and native plant diversity can occur in landscapes with a gradient of human disturbance, regardless of whether there is any negative effect of invasive species on native species. © IAVS; Opulus Press.","Carya; Disturbance; Forest fragmentation; Invasive species; Pinus echinata; Quercus; Restoration; Species diversity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-43449096005

However, much wildfire research has focused on the biological and physical aspects of wildfire, with comparatively less attention given to the importance of socio-economic factors. With recent changes in human activity and settlement patterns in many parts of Spain, potentially contributing to the increases in wildfire occurrence recently observed, the need to consider human activity in models of wildfire risk for this region are apparent. Here we use a method from Bayesian statistics, the weights of evidence (WofE) model, to examine the causal factors of wildfires in the south west of the Madrid region for two differently defined wildfire seasons. We also produce predictive maps of wildfire risk. Our results show that spatial patterns of wildfire ignition are strongly associated with human access to the natural landscape, with proximity to urban areas and roads found to be the most important causal factors We suggest these characteristics and recent socio-economic trends in Spain may be producing landscapes and wildfire ignition risk characteristics that are increasingly similar to Mediterranean regions with historically stronger economies, such as California, where the urban-wildland interface is large and recreation in forested areas is high. We also find that the WofE model is useful for estimating future wildfire risk. We suggest the methods presented here will be useful to optimize time, human resources and fire management funds in areas where urbanization is increasing the urban-forest interface and where human activity is an important cause of wildfire ignition. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Fire risk; GIS; Human-caused fires; Ignition risk; Socio-economic factors; Spatial pattern; Weights of evidence; Wildland fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-41049097112

We documented snag attributes in a mixed-conifer forest dominated by ponderosa pine in the Sierra Nevada, California where fire is being applied during spring. A total of 328 snags were monitored before and after fire on plots burned once, burned twice, or left unburned to assess the effects of prescribed fire on snag populations. The greatest loss of snags (7.1 snags ha-1 or 43%) followed the first introduction of fire after a long fire-free period. On plots burned a second time 21% of snags (3.6 snags ha-1) were lost, whereas 8% (1.4 snags ha-1) were lost on unburned control plots in the same time period. New snags replaced many of those lost reducing the net snag losses to 12% (2.0 ha-1) for plots burned once, and 3% (0.5 ha-1) for plots burned twice and unburned plots. We also examined snags used by cavity-nesting birds. Snags preferred for nesting were generally ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), larger diameter, and moderately decayed as compared to available snags. For monitored snags that met the preferred criteria, there was a net loss (1.7 snag ha-1 or 34%) after the first burn, while the loss of useable snags was less than 1 snag ha-1 following the second burn (15%) or on unburned controls (8%). We recommend protection of preferred snags, in particular large ponderosa pines, especially during primary fire applications on fire-suppressed landscapes.","Breeding biology; Cavity-nesting birds; Habitat selection; Prescribed fire; Sierra Nevada; Snags",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38649083095

Hibernating Louisiana Pine Snakes (Pituophis ruthveni; N = 7) in eastern Texas and Black Pine Snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus lodingi; N = S) in Mississippi were excavated to characterize their hibernacula. Pituophis ruthveni hibernated exclusively in burrows of Baird's Pocket Gophers (Geomys breviceps), whereas P. m. lodingi hibernated exclusively in chambers formed by the decay and burning of pine stumps and roots. All snakes hibernated singly at shallow depths (P. ruthveni mean = 19 cm, max. = 25 cm; P. m. lodingi mean = 25 cm, max. = 35 cm). Pituophis taxa at higher latitudes and elevations hibernate communally and at greater depths. In contrast to Northern Pine Snakes (Pituophis melanoleucus melanoleucus), none of the pine snakes in our study excavated hibernacula beyond minimal enlargement of the preexisting chambers. These differences are presumably the result of mild winters, an abundance of suitable sites offering sufficient thermal insulation, and reduced predation risk caused by absence of communal hibernation in traditional sites. It is increasingly apparent that, throughout their annual cycle, pine snakes are dependent upon fire-maintained pine ecosystems.

This richness can be explained by the architectural complexity of the studied forest resulting from the specific dynamics of riverside habitats: diversity of woody plant species, high vertical stratification, horizontal heterogeneity, abundance of large vines and vigour of plant growth are the most striking features of this habitat. Bird populations are similar to that of ordinary European Oak forest with three differences: a very high breeding density (50% higher), an abundance of shrubby habitats species in the heart of the forest, and the presence of species whose ecological optimum in Eastern France is cool montane habitat (Black Woodpecker, Dryocopus martius, Firecrest Regulus atricapillus, Common Tree-creeper Certhia familiaris, Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca).

Human activities have affected the distribution, composition, and structure of pine forests for millennia. Different human-mediated factors have affected different pine species in different ways in different regions. The most important factors affecting pine forests are altered fire regimes, altered grazing/browsing regimes, various harvesting/construction activities, land clearance and abandonment, purposeful planting and other manipulations of natural ecosystems, alteration of biotas through species reshuffling, and pollution. These changes are occurring against a backdrop of natural and anthropogenically driven climate change. We review past and current influence of humans in pine forests, seeking broad generalizations. These insights are combined with perspectives from paleoecology to suggest probable trajectories in the face of escalating human pressure. The immense scale of impacts and the complex synergies between agents of change calls for urgent and multifaceted action. Copyright © 2007 by Annual Reviews.

Front Street, Boise, ID 83702, United States","Models of habitat suitability in postfire landscapes are needed by land managers to make timely decisions regarding postfire timber harvest and other management activities. Many species of cavity-nesting birds are dependent on postfire landscapes for breeding and other aspects of their life history and are responsive to postfire management activities (e.g., timber harvest). In addition, several cavity nesters are designated as species at risk. We compare the ability of 2 types of models to distinguish between nest and non-nest locations of 6 cavity-nesting bird species (Lewis's woodpecker [Melanerpes lewis], black-backed woodpecker [Picoides arcticus], hairy woodpecker [P. villosus], northern flicker [Colaptes auratus], western bluebird [Sialia mexicana], and mountain bluebird [S. currucoides]) in the early postfire years for a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in Idaho, USA. The 2 model sets consisted of 1) models based on readily available remotely sensed data and 2) models containing field-collected data in addition to remotely sensed data (combination models). We evaluated models of nesting habitat by quantifying the model's ability to correctly identify nest and non-nest locations and by determining the percentage of correctly identified nest locations. Additionally, we developed relative habitat-suitability maps for nesting habitat of black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers from the best models. For all species except Lewis's woodpeckers, model performance improved with the addition of field-collected data. Models containing remotely sensed data adequately distinguished between nest and non-nest locations for black-backed woodpecker and Lewis's woodpecker only, whereas models containing both field-collected and remotely sensed data were adequate for all 6 species. Improvements in the availability of more accurate remote sensing technology would likely lead to improvements in the ability of the models to predict nesting locations. External validation with data from other wildfires is necessary to confirm the general applicability of our habitat-suitability models to other forests. Land managers responsible for maintaining habitat for cavity-nesting birds in postfire landscapes can use these models to identify potential nesting areas for these species and select areas in burned forests where postfire salvage logging is most likely to have minimal impacts on cavity-nesting bird habitats.","Burned coniferous forest; Cavity-nesting birds; Colaptes auratus; Habitat suitability; Melanerpes lewis; Nesting habitat; Picoides spp.; Receiver operating curves; Remotely sensed data; Sialia spp.",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38549122242

We applied bootstrap procedures to evaluate whether the observed data were true or just produced by chance, and then examined the emerging patterns at three levels: community, guild and species levels. At the community level, fire acted on breeding bird communities by altering especially the total abundance patterns: the species abundance decreased in the burnt pinewood compared to the residual one, but other parameters were not significantly affected by fire. As a consequence of fire, the destruction and structural simplification of the canopy and shrubby component, as well as the increase of edge habitat and patchiness at landscape scale, induced a turnover in species between pinewoods. Species turnover was higher at the burnt than at the residual pinewoods, during all the 3 years of study. At the guild level, the forest species decreased strongly in terms of richness and abundance in the burnt pinewoods, contrary to the edge and open habitat species which increased in terms of richness, abundance and evenness. Edge species showed the highest turnover in burnt pinewood during the whole period of study. At species level, after an a priori subdivision (based on bibliographic search) of the various species in two ecological guilds (forest versus edge species), it was found that an a posteriori statistical analysis confirmed the expected trend, i.e. that the species which decreased significantly in burnt pinewood were essentially the forest species, whereas the species which increased were essentially the edge/open habitat ones. Overall, in order to investigate the effects of fire catastrophes on birds, the guild approach seems more exhaustive than the taxonomic community approach, where intrinsic confounding trends are present. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Abundance; Breeding birds; Community ecology; Diversity; Edge species; Evenness; Fire; Forest species; Mediterranean; Pinewoods; Species richness",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-36148944835

To determine if seed availability limits southern red oak recruitment, we measured seed production, populations of small mammals, and seed removal across sites. To determine if seedling survival limits establishment, we outplanted greenhouse-raised southern red oak seedlings and followed their survival throughout one growing season. We also measured abiotic conditions such as canopy openness, soil moisture, and soil temperature, and censused longleaf pine recruitment. Contrary to expectations based on species' fire-tolerances, longleaf pine recruitment was consistent over the chronosequence, but there was little oak seedling establishment in the long-unburned sites. Sites last burned in the mid-1990s had the lowest oak seed rain, highest small-mammal populations, and highest seed -removal rates; yet, they had the highest oak seedling establishment. Seedling survival was highest in the pre-1950 sites, and was most influenced by intermediate light levels and high soil moisture. We conclude that biotic factors, specifically, seed removal by small mammals, are less important to seedling recruitment than abiotic factors in these forests. Further, the assumption that longleaf pine forests will eventually undergo to succession to hardwoods in the absence of fire is complicated by abiotic conditions associated with landscape position.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34848813837

In the forests of Alberta, Canada, the fire regime is dominated by large fires that create large regions of same-aged forest. Current forestry practices disperse harvest blocks across the landscape, causing increased fragmentation as compared with fire. Aggregating harvest blocks is one potential strategy to improve approximation of natural landscape pattern. We used a simulation approach to compare landscape pattern created by aggregated harvest strategies, the current dispersed harvest approach, and the natural disturbance regime for a 270000 ha forest landscape in northeastern Alberta. Compared with dispersed harvest, aggregated strategies increased compatibility with natural landscape pattern by reducing fragmentation. Capacity to aggregate harvest declined when the constraint of maintaining a constant proportion of deciduous to coniferous harvest was included. We conclude that aggregated harvest can improve implementation of the natural disturbance model by bringing several landscape metrics closer to the conditions that fall within the natural range of variability. Aggregated harvest alone, however, performed poorly at maintaining interior old forest, emphasizing that an explicit old-forest strategy is also required. © 2007 NRC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38149025420

We address the following questions: Are fire-induced damage and mortality greater in old than younger trees? Can management treatments ameliorate the detrimental effects of fire, competition-induced stress, and drought on old trees? Can management increase resistance of old trees to bark beetles? We offer the following recommendations for the use of thinning and burning treatments in old-growth ponderosa pine forests. Treatments should be focused on high-value stands where fire exclusion has increased fuels and competition and where detrimental effects of disturbance during harvesting can be minimized. Fuels should be reduced in the vicinity of old trees prior to prescribed burns to reduce fire intensity, as old trees are often more prone to dying after burning than younger trees. Raking the forest floor beneath old trees prior to burning may not only reduce damage from smoldering combustion under certain conditions but also increase fine-root mortality. Thinning of neighboring trees often increases water and carbon uptake of old trees within 1 year of treatment, and increases radial growth within several years to two decades after treatment. However, stimulation of growth of old trees by thinning can be negated by severe drought. Evidence from young trees suggests that management treatments that cause large increases in carbon allocation to radial xylem growth also increase carbon allocation to constitutive resin defenses against bark beetle attacks, but evidence for old trees is scarce. Prescribed, low-intensity burning may attract bark beetles and increase mortality of old trees from beetle attacks despite a stimulation of bole resin production. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Our study area was one of the last remaining tracts of old-growth longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), and alternating halves of the tract were burned during the breeding season during each year of our study. Mean home range size for males (N = 46) during the breeding season was 3.1 ha based on 95% fixed kernel analysis and 1.8 ha based on minimum convex polygons. Breeding season burning had no effect on male site fidelity and home range characteristics. The proportion of males remaining on burned areas was similar to the proportion remaining on unburned areas. Shifts in home range centroids pre- and postburn were also similar for males on unburned (median = 49.7 m) and burned (median = 65.6 m) areas. In addition, the size of home ranges that were burned (ha) was similar to that of home ranges that were not burned (ha). Estimated annual survival for males was 0.59. The median shift in annual home range centers calculated for 38 males observed during multiple breeding seasons was 63 m and, coupled with our survival estimates, suggest greater site fidelity than previously reported. These results suggest that breeding season burns were not as detrimental to Bachman's Sparrows as reported at other locations, and such burns may be helpful in maintaining suitable habitat. ©2007 Association of Field Ornithologists.","Aimophila aestivalis; Bachman's Sparrow; Home range; Prescribed burning; Site fidelity; Survival",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34548264627

Many bird spedes did not detectably decrease or increase in response to treatments. Species richness, total bird density, and some species, induding indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) and eastern bluebirds (Sialia sialis), increased in the mechanical + burn treatment after a 1-year to 2-year delay, eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens) increased immediately after treatment. Hooded warblers (Wilsonia citrina), black-and-white warblers (Mniotilta varia), and worm-eating warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus) dedined temporarily in some or all treatments, likely in response to understory and (or) leaf litter depth reductions. Densities of most species affected by treatments varied with shrub cover, tree or snag density, or leaf litter depth. High snag availability, open conditions, and a higher density of flying insects in the mechanical + burn treatment likely contributed to increased bird density and species richness. In our study, fuel reduction treatments that left the canopy intact, such as low-intensity prescribed fire or mechanical understory removal, had few detectable effects on breeding birds compared to the mechanical + burn treatment. High-intensity burning with heavy tree-kill, as occurred in our mechanical + burn treatment, can be used as a management tool to increase densities of birds associated with open habitat while retaining many forest and generalist spedes, but may have short-term adverse effects on some species that are associated with the ground- or shrub-strata for nesting and foraging.","Breeding birds; Burn; Fire surrogate; Fuel reduction; Prescribed fire; Southern appalachians",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-48249130385

This information is especially important for species that are in decline or otherwise of conservation concern. Populations of brown-headed nuthatches (Sitta pusilla), an obligate cavity nester, have declined throughout their range, primarily due to extensive habitat loss and degradation. To help guide habitat management for this species, we identified habitat features associated with variation in the number of offspring fledged within 2 populations in southern Florida, USA. The most important predictor of productivity was the date on which a nest attempt began, with earlier nests producing more fledglings. The number of large pine (Pinus elliottii var. densa) snags and, to a lesser extent, the number of small pine trees surrounding a nest site were positively associated with productivity. We recommend that land managers in southern Florida focus on providing abundant large pine snags because doing so will increase productivity and also may increase nest-site availability and the percentage of individuals that breed each year. Prescribed burning may be an effective way to increase the abundance of large pine snags; however, land managers should exercise caution when doing so because of the trade-off between snag recruitment and snag consumption that accompanies the use of fire. We lack the data required to predict the fire-return interval that optimizes this trade-off, but until these data are available we recommend increasing the spatial heterogeneity in fire-return interval and lengthening the fire-return interval in some areas to 5-6 years.","Breeding productivity; Everglades; Fire; Florida; Habitat management; Reintroduction; Sitta pusilla",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-44649193714

We hypothesized that (1) dominant males would aggregate caches to facilitate their defence, whereas subordinate females would scatter their caches more widely to avoid their discovery by males, (2) sexual differences in cache spacing would be context dependent, or occur only when birds were in pairs, and (3) patterns in cache spacing would facilitate cache retrieval and reduce cache theft. Females cached food further from food sources than males when they occurred in pairs. However, both sexes cached at similar distances when they were alone. Regardless of social context, females created more cache sites than males, and both sexes created more cache sites when they were together. Cache theft was frequently observed. Female-made caches were retrieved at similar rates by both males and females whereas male-made caches were more likely to be stolen by females than retrieved by the males that made them. Therefore, the results showed no support for the hypothesis that cache spacing patterns reduce cache theft.

In Spain, Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests are mainly subjected to three sylvopastoral management systems which determine variations in the forest structure: (i) ""young forests"" subjected to frequent disturbance by fires and clear-cuttings; (ii) ""Pyrenean oak dehesas"", subjected to a traditional sylvopastoral system exclusive to Spain which favours the development of both old oaks and pasture; (iii) largely undisturbed ""mature forests"". We examined the effects of these sylvopastoral management systems on habitat use and reproduction of the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius), a forest specialist bird, at the south-western edge of its distribution range. Habitat use was examined at multiple spatial scales. Within the territories, woodpeckers preferred large diameter oaks for foraging and decay oaks with holes for nesting. Within the forest tracts, no significant relationships between territory density and habitat structure in the forest tracts were found. At the landscape scale, dehesas and mature forests, both with high densities of important foraging and nesting trees, were occupied by woodpeckers. Young forests, with low densities of those trees, were avoided. No significant differences in territory density or reproductive success were found between dehesas and mature forests. The maintenance of viable woodpecker populations requires conservation actions at several spatial scales. Within the forest tracts, suitable densities of important foraging and nesting trees must be maintained. At the landscape scale, management decisions must consider the maintenance of traditional sylvopastoral systems in dehesas and mature forests.

As mixed-wood forests have recently become accessible for salvage operations, we studied woodpeckers in mixed-wood (trembling aspen Populus tremuloides and white spruce Picea glauca) and adjacent coniferous (black spruce Picea mariana and jack pine Pinus banksiana) areas to examine the effects of salvage logging and burn severity on these species. During 2003-2004 we carried out transect counts in 24 landscape units (625 ha each) that varied in pre-fire amount of merchantable mixed-wood (low = 7-15% and high = 25-35% of the unit area), salvage logging intensity (from control = no salvaging to high = 60-70% of merchantable mixed-wood harvested) and burn severity (estimates based on tree survival after fire). Six main findings are presented: (1) in mixed-wood areas subjected to salvage, total woodpecker abundance and woodpeckers of the genus Picoides (most notably black-backed woodpecker Picoides arcticus) responded negatively to increasing salvage logging intensity; (2) northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) showed a marginally significant positive response to salvage in the mixed-wood areas; (3) the salvage response of the black-backed woodpecker was season dependent (first post-fire summer, winter and second post-fire summer compared); (4) in coniferous but not in mixed-wood areas, black-backed woodpecker responded positively to increasing burn severity. Moreover, the response in coniferous habitat was stronger in the first post-fire summer, compared to the subsequent winter and the second post-fire summer. In the retained mixed-wood areas, northern flicker responded positively to increasing burn severity; (5) the majority of the detected 73 woodpecker nests with chicks were in trembling aspen trees or in mixed-wood stands; (6) among coniferous tree species, dead standing jack pine and white spruce trees had much greater evidence of woodpecker foraging than had black spruce (ca. 65-75% versus 15% of trees). These results indicate the crucial influence of salvage logging, the amount of retained mixed-wood forests and burn severity on woodpecker abundance. Hence we recommend retention of large, burned mixed-wood areas during salvage harvesting to support these dead-wood dependent birds. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In recent decades, however, frequency of flooding has decreased and frequency of wildfires has increased. Riparian forests provide important breeding habitat for a large variety of bird species, and the effects of this altered disturbance regime on birds and their breeding habitat is largely unknown. To evaluate effects of high-intensity spring and summer wildfire on the quality of breeding bird habitat in the Middle Rio Grande valley, we measured vegetation structure and composition, avian nest use, and nest success at 4 unburned plots and 4 wildfire plots over a 3-year period. We measured avian nest use and success at nest boxes located in unburned riparian forest plots and plots recently burned by wildfire. Recent wildfire plots (<7 yr after fire) had a much different vegetation structure than unburned plots; an older (>7 yr after fire) wildfire plot more closely resembled its paired unburned plot than did recently burned plots. Ash-throated flycatchers (Myiarchus cinerascens) and Bewick's wrens (Thryomanes bewickii; hereafter, flycatchers and wrens, respectively) used nest boxes in most of the plots. A model selection procedure applied to logistic regressions showed that frequency of nest box use by flycatchers was positively associated with wildfire, although flycatchers used boxes in unburned plots as well. Wrens showed a preferential use of nest boxes that were in unburned sites and in close proximity to vegetative cover. Growth rates, feeding rates, and fledging mass of flycatchers were similar in wildfire and unburned plots. Growth rates for wrens were slower in wildfire plots, while feeding rates and fledging mass were similar. Nest predation varied between years, was higher for flycatchers than for wrens, and was not directly influenced by wildfire. Model selection showed that predation increased with grass cover, an indicator of forest openness, and decreased with distance to habitat edge. Recovery of dense vegetation appears important in maintaining populations of Bewick's wrens, whereas ash-throated flycatchers were less sensitive to vegetative structure and composition of postfire succession. Postfire management that maintains nest sites in large forest strips would enhance nesting density and success of these cavity-nesting birds in riparian zones.","Ash-throated flycatcher; Bewick's wren; Middle Rio Grande; Riparian vegetation; Secondary cavity-nesting; Vegetation structure; Wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249087115

This fire regime has maintained high levels of biodiversity in terms of both species richness and endemism. Land use changes have reduced the area of this ecosystem by >95%, and inadequate fire frequencies threaten many of the remnants today. In the absence of frequent fire, rapid colonization of hardwoods and shrubs occurs, and a broad-leaved midstory develops. This midstory encroachment has been the focus of much research and management concern, largely based on the assumption that the midstory reduces understory plant diversity through direction competition via light interception. The general application of this mechanism of degradation is questionable, however, because midstory density, leaf area, and hardwood species composition vary substantially along a soil moisture gradient from mesic to extremely xeric sites. Reanalysis of recently reported data from xeric longleaf pine communities suggests that the development of the forest floor, a less conspicuous change in forest structure, might cause a decline in plant biodiversity when forests remain unburned. We report here a test of the interactions among fire, litter accumulation, forest floor development, and midstory canopy density on understory plant diversity. Structural equation modeling showed that within xeric sites, forest floor development was the primary factor explaining decreased biodiversity. The only effects of midstory development on biodiversity were those mediated through forest floor development. Boundary line analysis of functional guilds of understory plants showed sensitivity to even minor development of the forest floor in the absence of fire. These results challenge the prevailing management paradigm and suggest that within xeric longleaf pine communities, the primary focus of managed fire regime should be directed toward the restoration of forest floor characteristics rather than the introduction of high-intensity fires used to regulate midstory structure. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.","Duff accumulation; Fire; Forest floor; Litter; Longleaf pine; Pinus palustris; Restoration; Sandhill community; Structural equation modeling",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247211756

Mill.) woodland. Trenched and nontrenched plots were replicated in the woodland matrix, at gap edges, and in gap centers representing a range of overstory stocking. One-half of each plot received a herbicide treatment to remove the understory. We monitored pine survival and growth, understory productivity, light level (gap fraction), and soil resources. The overstory facilitated pine seedling survival. Pine seedling growth was reduced as overstory stocking increased. Reduced growth of seedlings was also observed in gaps when the understory was left intact. Understory plants competed with seedlings by filling the root gaps that developed as a result of overstory disturbance. Hardwood growth increased in gaps, owing to decreased belowground competition with adult pines, while growth of herbaceous plants and pine seedlings increased with light availability. Large overstory gaps are not required to initiate regeneration in longleaf pine woodlands. Retaining overstory dispersed throughout the stand but variable in density, through single-tree selection approaches, may be an alternative to gap-based approaches.

However, it is unclear if this function continues with postburn succession as predators recolonize burned habitats and snag density declines. Lewis's Woodpeckers (Melanerpes lewis) are considered ""burn specialists"" and are a species of conservation concern. We monitored Lewis's Woodpeckers nesting in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests to determine the source or sink function of old-burn habitats in the Black Hills of South Dakota (study units burned in 1988 and 1991); concurrently, we examined avian and mammalian predator communities within burned and unburned areas. Between 2002 and 2005 we found 55 Lewis's Woodpecker nests, 51 of which were successful. Using adult and juvenile mortality rates for other melanerpine species taken from the literature, we determined that the old-burn habitats we sampled were acting as sources for Lewis's Woodpeckers. Point counts and tracking tube surveys suggested that both avian and mammalian predators had successfully recolonized these old-burn habitats, as both groups were common in old burns and in unburned forests. The unusually high nesting success of Lewis's Woodpeckers in the Black Hills is likely due to the absence of some common nest predators. While the high success rates might continue, we suggest that the overall contribution of young to the region from these burned sites will decline as suitable habitat components (such as snags) decline with the continuation of postfire succession. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2007.","Black Hills; Cavity nesting; Melanerpes lewis; Ponderosa pine; Predation; Wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33847234647

We evaluated diurnal summer roost selection by the bat community at the forest-stand level in a diversely forested landscape in the Ouachita Mountains of central Arkansas. Over a 6-year period, we evaluated 428 roost locations for 162 individual bats of 6 species. Using Euclidean distance analysis and individual bat as the experimental unit, all 6 species were selective (P < 0.05) in their choice of roosting habitat. Five of six species preferred (P < 0.05) to roost in or near mature (≥50 years old), mixed pine-hardwood forest that had undergone recent partial harvest, midstory removal, and burning; 41.3% of roosts were located in that habitat but it comprised an average of only 22.8% of available habitat. Five of six species also preferred older (≥100 years old), relatively unmanaged, mixed pine-hardwood forest. Although 19.9% of roosts from all species were located in 50- to 99-year-old, second-growth forests of mixed pine-hardwood (average of 21.0% of available habitat), that habitat was preferred by no species of bat. In partially harvested stands, unharvested buffer strips (greenbelts) surrounding ephemeral streams were used at differing levels by each species; most (90%) eastern pipistrelle (Pipistrellus subflavus) roosts were in greenbelts whereas few (2.7%) Seminole bat (Lasiurus seminolus) roosts were in greenbelts. Older forests, thinned mature forests with reduced midstories, and greenbelts retained in harvested areas were all important roosting habitats for the bat community in the Ouachita Mountains.

B.S.P.] coarse woody debris (CWD) in northern Quebec is estimated in this study using a 29-yr postfire chronosequence. Sampling was performed using both trunk-window traps and rearing from snag and log sections. A total of 37,312 arthropods (>220 taxa) were collected from both sampling methods. Two distinct colonization waves were identified. The onset of initial colonization occurs the year of the fire, whereas the second colonization phase begins only once debris falls to the ground. The initial colonization step is influenced by fire-associated species including subcortical predators, xylophages, and ascomycetes feeders. Abundance of most early colonizer species decline with time since fire with the disappearance of subcortical habitat. No noticeable species turnover occurred in snags thereafter. Lack of succession in snags is related to very low decomposition rates for postfire CWD because this substrate is unsuitable for species associated with highly decayed wood. Snag falling triggers fungal growth and concomitant saproxylic succession toward micro- and saprophagous species and increases accessibiltity for soil-dwelling organisms. Because the position of woody debris greatly influences overall physical properties of dead wood, the fall of burned CWD plays a major role in saproxylic community shift after fire. © 2007 Entomological Society of America.","Black spruce; Boreal forest; Coarse woody debris; Fire; Saproxylic insects",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34047183605

Differences in landscape patterns derived from these two sources of disturbance have, however, raised concerns that the way forest harvesting has been dispersed is potentially shifting patterns away from the natural range. In the context of natural disturbance-based management, we used a spatially explicit model designed to capture general fire regimes in order to quantify temporal variability associated with regenerating areas (burnt areas of 25 years or younger), and to develop strategic objectives for harvest agglomeration sizes and dispersion. We first evaluated temporal variability in the proportion of stands younger than 100 years (assumed to be even-aged stands) for various fire regimes (seven fire cycles: 50 to 400 years, and three mean fires sizes: 3000, 15 000 and 60 000 ha). Secondly, we quantified the size distribution and dispersion of regenerating areas for each fire regime. As expected by theoretical fire frequencies and size distributions, the importance of even-aged stands at the forest management unit level was found to decrease with longer fire cycles. However, the temporal variability associated with these proportions is shown to increase with mean fire size. It was also observed that the size distribution and dispersion of regenerating areas was primarily influenced by mean fire size. Based on these observations, natural disturbance-based management objectives were formulated, providing guidelines on harvest agglomeration size and dispersion.","Age distribution; Boreal forest; Clearcut agglomeration size distribution; Fire regime; Fire size distribution; Forest management; Temporal variability",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-35548980931

This synthesis indicates that weather events influence both spatial and temporal patterns of forests and insect communities in North American landscapes. The Atlantic and Pacific oceanic sides of the continent are relatively more susceptible to ice and wind storms, respectively. There have been more studies and reports on the responses of forest insects to wind storms, and on economically important subcortical insects than on gall-forming, foliage-feeding, fungal-feeding, litter-dwelling, pollinating, parasitizing, predaceous, root-feeding, and sap-feeding insects. Weather events positively affect populations of subcortical insect species, and impact their colonization patterns and dynamics. Species belonging to genera such as Dendroctonus (Scolytidae) and Monochamus (Cerambycidae) may sometimes cause economic damage by colonizing residual live tree, and dead trees, rendering the wood unsalvageable. Subsequent outbreaks of spruce beetle, Dendroctonus rufipennis (Kirby) and Douglas-fir beetle, Dendroctonus pseudotsugae Hopkins, have been frequently documented in western North American forests following wind events. Wind disturbances have also been observed to accelerate the life-cycles of D. rufipennis and Semanotus litigiosus (Casey) (Cerambycidae), and in rare instances, have caused Monochamus spp. to become primary colonizers. Populations of other important subcortical species have not always increased dramatically following weather events. Foliage-and pollen-feeding insects may experience mortality directly from a weather event or indirectly through habitat alteration. In some cases, forest insects may use storms to migrate to new habitats. Populations of open-habitat and forest specialist litter-dwelling species have increased and decreased, respectively, subsequent to weather events. Forest specialist species generally rebound within a short period of time, suggesting that they are adapted to these periodic weather events. Little is known about the combined effects of post-weather-disturbance management practices such as salvage-logging and prescribed-burning on insects in North American forests. © 2007 NRC Canada.","Dendroctonus; Disturbances; Flooding; Forest insects; Ice storms; Weather events; Wind storms",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-38149038779

We evaluated the ecological distinctiveness and conservation value of savannas and woodlands by examining bird distributions across a fire-maintained woody-vegetation gradient in northwest Indiana encompassing five habitats - open habitats with low canopy cover, savannas, woodlands, scrublands, and forests - during migration, breeding, and overwintering. Savannas and woodlands were significantly different in overall bird species composition from open and forest habitats but were often intermediate between open and forest in guild densities. Few bird species were consistently and highly concentrated in savannas or woodlands, and the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) was the only species significantly more abundant in savannas and woodlands than in open, scrub, and forest habitats. Fire frequency over a 15-year interval was a significant predictor of bird community composition and was positively related to species diversity, spring transient migrant density, and density of the most threatened species. Each habitat type had characteristics potentially important for avian conservation. Scrub had the highest density of transient migrants, which suggests it plays an important role as migration stopover habitat. More species were significantly concentrated in open or forest habitats than in the other habitats. Lack of species concentration and intermediate community composition suggested that birds experienced savannas and woodlands more as ecotones than as habitats distinct from forests or grasslands. However, this intermediate character can benefit conservation, as evidenced by savannas and woodlands having the highest density of the most threatened species along this woody-vegetation gradient. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2007.","Ecotones; Fire frequency; Indicator species; Oak savanna; Oak woodland; Seasonal effects; Stopover habitat",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34547761204

The process of restoration dramatically alters forest stands, and the effects of these changes on wildlife remain unclear. Our research evaluated which aspects of habitat alteration from restoration treatments may be affecting the habitat quality of Western Bluebird (Sialia mexicana), an insectivorous songbird whose populations are declining. Habitat loss resulting from fire-suppression activities may be partially responsible for their population declines; thus, the bluebird is a good representative species for assessing how the reconstruction of presuppression forest conditions can affect wildlife. We measured habitat variables at 63 successful and 19 unsuccessful Western Bluebird nests in 1999-2001 and 2003. We compared habitat models that represented bluebird biology and habitat changes from restoration. Two models of nest success that included (1) an increased herbaceous and bare ground cover and (2) increased Gambel oak (Quercus gambelii) densities and reduced Ponderosa pine densities were most supported by the data. Increased herbaceous ground cover and Gambel oak density likely represent improved invertebrate assemblages and thus improved forage abundance for nesting bluebirds. Lower Ponderosa pine densities may provide bluebirds with open perches from which to hunt and thereby improve the availability of invertebrates as a food source. We also provide a landscape-scale example of changes to bluebird habitat quality from treatments, which we recommend as a useful tool in restoration planning. © 2006 Society for Ecological Restoration International.","Forest restoration; Gambel oak; Habitat quality; Ponderosa pine; Sialia mexicana; Western Bluebird",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33751027515

Even though bird diversity indices did not differ between burned and unburned stands, species-specific bird abundance was associated with habitat variables in three burned and four unburned stands. Total cavity-nesting bird abundance was greater in burned stands. Most cavity-nesting birds were observed in mixed-species flocks. Individual species of these flocks were associated with different habitat variables within stands. Numbers of woodpeckers were significantly greater in burned stands and numbers of chickadees were significantly greater in unburned stands.

Using point-counts, radiotelemetry, and focal bird observation, we assessed the relative abundance, home range size and composition, and habitat use by foraging hairy woodpeckers in 3 stands that had experienced wildfire in 1996, 2000, or 2002. Because we conducted the study over 2 years, we used the 1996 fire to represent 6 and 7 years after fire, while we used the 2000 fire to represent 2 and 3 years after fire in a space-for-time substitution chronosequence analysis. We also assessed bark beetle and woodborer density by x-raying bark samples collected from a subset of trees within burned areas. We detected significantly greater hairy woodpecker relative abundance in burned forests representing 1 and 2 years after fire, and bark beetle and woodborer density was highest in these stands as well. Woodpecker home range size increased across stands representing increasing time since fire. Within a burn, hairy woodpeckers used high-severity burned areas more than moderate-severity burned areas representing 2 and 3 years after fire, but not m areas representing 6 and 7 years after fire. Bark beetle and woodborer densities were also higher in high-severity burned stands representing 2 and 3 years after fire. Hairy woodpeckers used edges of high-severity burned areas more than the interior. We hypothesize that an initial increase in bark beetle and woodborer density following fire allowed for higher woodpecker abundance and smaller home ranges, but as burned forests aged, bark beetle and woodborer density within trees decreased, killed trees fell, and, in response, hairy woodpecker relative abundance decreased and home range size increased. These patterns suggest that high-severity burned areas provide important but ephemeral resources to this dominant primary cavity-nester. The higher bark beetle and woodborer densities and greater use of edges of high-severity burned areas by woodpeckers suggests that salvage logging of these areas could remove potential prey and preferred foraging areas for hairy woodpeckers, especially when trees are removed along severely burned edges.","Arizona; Foraging behavior; Hairy woodpecker; Home range; Picoides villosus; Pinus ponderosa; Ponderosa pine; Prey resources; Wildfire; Winter ecology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845459390

We found 563 active nests of 18 cavity-nesting birds; all species were found nesting in the uncut burned forest plots, but only eight nested in the salvage-logged plots. All except one species nested at a higher density in the unlogged areas, and half of the species were significantly more abundant in the unlogged plots. Every timber-drilling and timber-gleaning species was less abundant in the salvage-logged plots, including two of the most fire-dependent species in the northern Rocky Mountains - American Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) and Black-backed (P. arcticus) Woodpeckers. Lower abundances in salvage-logged plots occurred despite the fact that there were still more potential nest snags per hectare than the recommended minimum number needed to support maximum densities of primary cavity-nesters, which suggests that reduced woodpecker densities are more related to a reduction in food (wood-boring beetle larvae) than to nest-site availability. Because cavities were present in only four of 244 randomly selected trees, and because frequency of cavity reuse by secondary cavity-nesters was higher in salvage-logged than in unlogged plots, nest-site limitation may be a more important constraint for secondary cavity-nesters in salvage-logged areas. These results suggest that typical salvage logging operations are incompatible with the maintenance of endemic levels of most cavity-nesting bird populations, especially populations of primary cavity-nesting species. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2006.","Black-backed Woodpecker; Cavity-nesting birds; Fire; Healthy forests; Salvage logging",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33845215798

The rationale is that management that favours landscape compositions and stand structures similar to those found historically should also maintain biodiversity and essential ecological functions. In fire-dominated landscapes, this approach is feasible only if current and future fire frequencies are sufficiently low compared with the preindustrial fire frequency, so a substitution of fire by forest management can occur without elevating the overall frequency of disturbance. We address this question by comparing current and simulated future fire frequency based on 2 x CO2 and 3 x CO2 scenarios to historical reconstructions of fire frequency in the commercial forests of Quebec. For most regions, current and simulated future fire frequencies are lower than the historical fire frequency, suggesting that forest management could potentially be used to maintain or recreate the age-class distribution of fire-dominated preindustrial landscapes. Current even-aged management, however, tends to reduce forest variability by, for example, truncating the natural age-class distribution and eliminating mature and old-growth forests from the landscape. Therefore, in the context of sustainable forest management, silvicultural techniques that retain a spectrum of forest compositions and structures at different scales are necessary to maintain this variability and thereby allow a substitution of fire by harvesting. © 2006 NRC.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247200025

However, it is only recently that an appreciable amount of scientific data has emerged on this topic. In this report, we present our review of the similarities and differences between the ecological effects of fire- and harvesting-induced disturbances that have been noted in the scientific literature. Comparisons of the effects of these disturbances on numerous forest attributes (coarse woody debris, soil nutrients, productivity, plant diversity, wildlife response) are presented at two distinct spatial scales: stand and landscape. At the stand scale, our review noted significant differences between harvesting and wildfire early after disturbance. Structurally, young post-fire stands are characterized by more snags, less downed woody debris, and significantly thinner forest floors than logged sites. Additionally, while both disturbances generate a pulse of extractable nutrients, the intensity of the pulse is greater after wildfire than clearcut harvesting and an increase in soil pH is observed after fire as opposed to little change or a slight decrease after harvesting. Early after disturbance, biodiversity elements significantly differ between burned and logged sites. Dissimilar understory vascular and non-vascular communities generally colonize burned and logged sites, although differences are usually a question of abundance rather than species absence/presence. As compared to fire, faunal assemblages, be it mammals, invertebrates or birds, all seem to respond differently to harvesting. Among these faunal groups, species specifically associated with snags were the most likely to show a contrasting response to harvesting- and wildfire-induced disturbances. Tree species respond differently to fire- and harvesting-induced disturbances, with harvesting favouring the establishment of deciduous species (notably trembling aspen, Populus tremulpides) and of coniferous tree species not adapted to fire such as balsam fir (Abies balsamea). Furthermore, there are commonly more residual deciduous trees in clearcuts than in fires. Because of this and the differential response of tree species to these two types of disturbances, divergent successional patterns with respect to overstory tree species compositions can be observed in burned and harvested stands. While we noted some variability among studies, stand and tree productivity are generally similar in burned and logged sites. When the effects of harvesting- and wildfire-induced disturbances are compared at longer temporal scales, our review noted that most forest attributes that were reported as dissimilar early after disturbance converged a few decades post-disturbance. Nonetheless, thicker forest floors observed after logging as compared to fire appear to persist numerous decades after disturbance. Additionally, while faunal communities do become less different as time passes, late in succession, some species present in burned stands are either significantly less abundant or absent in similarly aged logged stands. Finally, several studies warn that while the effects of wildfire- and harvesting-induced disturbances do not significantly differ after a few decades, there is some concern about the ability of harvesting-induced disturbances to recreate the full range of natural variability observed during post-fire stand succession. Unfortunately, little research has compared the effects of alternative silvicultuial interventions (partial retention, partial cutting, etc.) or site preparation techniques (controlled burning, scarification, etc.) to the effects of wildfires. However, the few studies comparing the effects of post-logging control burns and different levels of retention indicate that these practices may attenuate some of the differences observed early after disturbance. Our review indicates that as compared to wildfire alone, salvage logging can have significant effects on ecological processes, biological legacies and the abundance of species commonly encountered only after fire. Removal of fire-killed trees can affect tree regeneration, understory composition, the abundance and distribution of dead wood, wildlife habitat, and soil properties. Nonetheless, many of these effects are site-specific; hence, additional investments in research are needed to support management decisions and policy development. At the landscape scale, the main difference between fire and harvesting regimes is the distribution of stand age classes. The proportion of stands older than the rotation period (usually 100 yrs) tends toward zero under a fully regulated harvesting regime, while it is around 35% under a fire regime of similar rotation period. This fundamental difference results in a significant loss of advanced seral stage forests in managed landscapes, thereby affecting organisms that are primarily associated with such stands. Interestingly, since harvesting-induced disturbances are unable to recreate the conditions commonly found in young burned stands, landscapes under the influence of harvesting will also be characterized by a reduction of stands capable of replacing the ecological role of young burned stands within landscapes. Unfortunately, only a few studies have empirically compared the effects of wildfire and harvesting at the landscape scale under similar rotation periods. Nonetheless, research demonstrates that fires usually produce more heterogeneous landscapes than clearcuts, with more remnant islands. Fires are also more complex in shape, and have edges that are more gradual than clearcuts. In conclusion, our review reveals two main challenges faced by forest managers in order to generate similar ecological effects as produced by fire. First, managers need to improve management practices in order to minimize the differences observed between young post-harvest stands and young post-fire stands, particularly with respect to coarse woody debris and soil conditions. Second, managers need to maintain some areas with the tree species composition and structural attributes characteristic of over-mature fire-origin stands. Such stands can occupy a significant portion of fire-mediated landscapes. This may necessitate lengthening the rotation period of a certain proportion of stands within managed landscapes or may require the application of alternative harvesting methods that can recreate the structure and tree composition characteristic of advanced serai stage stands. This review concludes by identifying future research needs that might help meet these challenges. © 2006 by the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc.","Biodiversity; Clearcut; Coarse woody debris; Compound disturbance; Disturbance regime; Forest productivity; Harvesting landscape; Landscape composition; Landscape configuration; Salvage logging; Scientific literature review; Soil nutrients; Soil organic matter",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33751189836

The Corsican nuthatch prefers older Corsican pine stands with tall, large trees, and avoids younger stands, both in the breeding and wintering seasons. This preference is explained by the greater availability of pine seeds from older trees. Territorial adults are almost completely sedentary, a trait that is influenced by seed hoarding behaviour. From late autumn to early spring (i.e., when cones are mature), and during sunny weather (i.e., when cones are open), nuthatches remove pine seeds from cones and cache them on branches and under the bark of trunks. The birds retrieve the cached seeds in cold and wet weather. The presence of old Corsican pine stands appears to be a key-factor in the survival of the Corsican nuthatch, whose habitat is currently threatened by logging and fires. © Journal of Avian Biology.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748345808

We focused on thinning and/or prescribed fire studies in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and dry-type Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta), and mixed coniferous forests. Overall, there are tremendous gaps in information needed to evaluate the effects of fuel reduction on the majority of species found in our focal area. Differences among studies in location, fuel treatment type and size, and pre- and post-treatment habitat conditions resulted in variability in species responses. In other words, a species may respond positively to fuel reduction in one situation and negatively in another. Despite these issues, a few patterns did emerge from this synthesis. In general, fire-dependent species, species preferring open habitats, and species that are associated with early successional vegetation or that consume seeds and fruit appear to benefit from fuel reduction activities. In contrast, species that prefer closed-canopy forests or dense understory, and species that are closely associated with those habitat elements that may be removed or consumed by fuel reductions, will likely be negatively affected by fuel reductions. Some habitat loss may persist for only a few months or a few years, such as understory vegetation and litter that recover quickly. The loss of large-diameter snags and down wood, which are important habitat elements for many wildlife and invertebrate species, may take decades to recover and thus represent some of the most important habitat elements to conserve during fuel reduction treatments. Management activities that consider the retention of habitat structures (such as snags, down wood, and refugia of untreated stands) may increase habitat heterogeneity and may benefit the greatest number of species in the long run.","Dry coniferous forests; Fuel reduction; Habitat; Invertebrates; Prescribed fire; Thinning; Western United States; Wildlife",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34247402146

The increased use of prescribed fire generates questions regarding the effects of single- and multiple-burning events on leaf-litter and ground-dwelling arthropods, and recovery of these arthropods following fire disturbance. In this study, the effects of early season single- and multiple-burns were assessed on leaf-litter arthropods and ground-dwelling arthropods in oak-pine forests for two growing seasons following fire disturbance. Arthropods were sampled by leaf-litter extraction and pitfall trapping, where pitfall trapping was restricted to single-burned areas. For each sampling method, arthropod abundance, diversity, richness, and evenness were calculated at the family or ordinal level. Forest characteristics were also surveyed to measure impacts from the prescribed fires and to assess variability in the forest environment. Leaf-litter arthropod abundance was devastated by burning, and resurgence of populations was not evident until the second growing season in the multiple-burned areas. In single-burned plots, litter arthropod abundance remained low for the duration of the study possibly due to greater fire intensity relative to the multiple-burn plots. Leaf-litter arthropod diversity was not affected by either burn regime. Burning decreased leaf-litter arthropod richness and increased leaf-litter arthropod evenness, but these effects were only marginally significant. Prescription burning had no impact on ground-dwelling arthropod abundance, diversity, or richness, but arthropod community evenness increased following the single-burn disturbance. In the principal components analysis (PCA), burning was a major gradient explaining 46% of the variation in the data. Burning decreased leaf-litter cover and depth and lower canopy cover, and contributed to the variance explained by PCA. Our data confirm that prescription burning is accomplishing its management goal of removing undesirable lower-canopy cover in the mixed hardwood forests of the Cumberland Plateau. Following early-season, low-intensity burns, recovery of leaf-litter arthropods was not evident until two-growing seasons after fire disturbance. Any differences we observed could be attributed to lower fire intensity in forests that are repeatedly burned. Prescribed burns should be utilized on a rotation greater than 2 years to allow resurgence of the leaf-litter arthropod community and recovery of the leaf-litter habitat. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

As a consequence, there have been predictions of a substantial decline in Leadbeater's possum populations over the next 40 years. If this is to be averted, or reduced in extent, then an immediate means of increasing den site availability for the species is required. The results of a recent investigation into nest-box use by the species in lowland swamp forest demonstrate that high rates of occupancy can be achieved by targeting established colonies at sites where the vegetation structure is suitable for box installation. This suggests that nest boxes can be an effective means of increasing den-site availability for the possum, and therefore have considerable potential to contribute to the species' conservation in the short term. Such measures should be applied in conjunction with altered forestry practises that better provide for the retention and future provision of mature hollow-bearing trees. © CSIRO 2006.",,Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33747166480

Removal of snags through postfire salvage logging reduces the densities and size classes of snags remaining after wildfire. We determined important variables associated with annual persistence rates (the probability a snag remains standing from 1 year to the next) of large conifer snags (≥23 cm diameter breast height (dbh)). Our study sites were located within two wildfires in western Idaho (Foothills fire of 1992 and Star Gulch fire of 1994). Study sites in the Foothills were partially salvage-logged (one-half of standing snags ≥23 cm dbh removed), and sites in the Star Gulch burn were unlogged. Snags were monitored within 0.04 ha plots for 8-9 years beginning in 1994 in Foothills Burn and 1995 in the Star Gulch Burn. A total of 1131 ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir snags (Pseudotsuga menziesii) were monitored during the study period. Data were collected on snag species, height, decay class, and diameter at breast height. We also collected stand-level data (e.g., slope, aspect) and quantified information on remotely sensed data (e.g., pre-fire crown closure, burn severity) at the pixel-level (30 m × 30 m) and within 1 km of the plot centers (landscape-level). We modeled annual snag persistence as a function of data on all three scales using non-linear mixed-effects models. Additionally, we expected that variables on multiple scales, including information on burn severity and pre-fire crown closure, would be influential in determining snag persistence. The best models of snag persistence were selected using an information theoretic approach (i.e., AICc). Small-scale variables (age, height, dbh, tree species, decay, and snag density) were best predictors for both wildfire areas. In contrast to our expectations that large-scale variables would influence annual persistence rates, these factors did not appear in top models. Persistence was shorter for ponderosa pine than Douglas-fir snags. Additionally, smaller snags in plots with fewer snags fell sooner than did larger snags in more dense stands. Age of snag was also an important variable predicting snag persistence (older snags are more likely to fall). Snag longevity (the total amount of time the snag remained standing) also varied between the two sites. The predicted half-life of a ponderosa pine snag was 7-8 years in salvage-logged plots and 9-10 years in unlogged plots. The predicted half-life of Douglas-fir snags was longer than ponderosa pine, at 12-13 years in the salvage logged burn versus 15-16 years in the unlogged burn. On the partially logged sites, the primary effects of salvage logging on snags appeared to be the reduction of the average snag size (diameter and height) and density, which in turn reduced the subsequent longevity of individual snags. We concluded that the main effects of the partial-salvage logging appeared to be a reduction in overall snag density and average snag size which in turn reduces average persistence time. Management practices that preserve dense stands of snags will promote the longer-term persistence of suitable snags as nesting habitat for cavity-nesting birds.","Douglas-fir; Idaho; Pinus ponderosa; Ponderosa pine; Postfire salvage logging; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Snag dynamics; Snag longevity; Wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746305276

T6G 2H1, Canada","In North American boreal forests, wildfire is the dominant agent of natural disturbance. A natural-disturbance model has therefore been promoted as an ecologically based approach to forest harvesting in these systems. Given accelerating resource demands, fire competes with harvest for timber, and there is increasing pressure to salvage naturally burned areas. This creates a management paradox: simultaneous promotion of natural disturbance as a guide to sustainability while salvaging forests that have been naturally disturbed. The major drivers of postfire salvage in Canadian boreal forests are societal perceptions, overallocation of forest resources, and economic and policy incentives, and postfire salvage compromises forest sustainability by diminishing the role of fire as a critical, natural process. These factors might be reconciled through consideration of fire in resource allocations and application of active adaptive management. We provide novel treatment of the role of burn severity in mediating biotic response by examining its influence on the amount, type, and distribution of live, postfire residual material, and we highlight the role of fire in shaping spatial and temporal patterns in forest biodiversity. Maintenance of natural postfire forests is a critical component of an ecosystem-based approach to forest management in boreal systems. Nevertheless, present practices focus heavily on expediting removal of timber from burned forests, despite increasing evidence that postfire communities differ markedly from postharvest systems, and there is a mismatch between emerging management models and past management practices. Policies that recognize the critical role of fire in these systems and facilitate enhanced understanding of natural system dynamics in support of development of sustainable management practices are urgently needed. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.","Boreal forest; Canada; Ecosystem management; Postfire salvage harvest",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746332947

Such operations may reduce or eliminate biological legacies, modify rare postdisturbance habitats, influence populations, alter community composition, impair natural vegetation recovery, facilitate the colonization of invasive species, alter soil properties and nutrient levels, increase erosion, modify hydrological regimes and aquatic ecosystems, and alter patterns of landscape heterogeneity. These impacts can be assigned to three broad and interrelated effects: (1) altered stand structural complexity; (2) altered ecosystem processes and functions; and (3) altered populations of species and community composition. Some impacts may be different from or additional to the effects of traditional logging that is not preceded by a large natural disturbance because the conditions before, during, and after salvage logging may differ from those that characterize traditional timber harvesting. The potential impacts of salvage logging often have been overlooked, partly because the processes of ecosystem recovery after natural disturbance are still poorly understood and partly because potential cumulative effects of natural and human disturbance have not been well documented. Ecologically informed policies regarding salvage logging are needed prior to major natural disturbances so that when they occur ad hoc and crisis-mode decision making can be avoided. These policies should lead to salvage-exemption zones and limits on the amounts of disturbance-derived biological legacies (e.g., burned trees, logs) that are removed where salvage logging takes place. Finally, we believe new terminology is needed. The word salvage implies that something is being saved or recovered, whereas from an ecological perspective this is rarely the case. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.","Forest management; Human disturbance; Natural disturbance",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746342746

Thus, it is critical to develop and apply appropriate snag-management guidelines to implement postfire timber harvest operations in the same locations. Unfortunately, existing guidelines designed for green-tree forests cannot be applied to postfire salvage sales because the snag needs of snag-dependent species in burned forests are not at all similar to the snag needs of snag-dependent species in green-tree forests. Birds in burned forests have very different snag-retention needs from those cavity-nesting bird species that have served as the focus for the development of existing snag-management guidelines. Specifically, many postfire specialists use standing dead trees not only for nesting purposes but for feeding purposes as well. Woodpeckers, in particular, specialize on wood-boring beetle larvae that are superabundant in fire-killed trees for several years following severe fire. Species such as the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) are nearly restricted in their habitat distribution to severely burned forests. Moreover, existing postfire salvage-logging studies reveal that most postfire specialist species are completely absent from burned forests that have been (even partially) salvage logged. I call for the long-overdue development and use of more meaningful snag-retention guidelines for postfire specialists, and I note that the biology of the most fire-dependent bird species suggests that even a cursory attempt to meet their snag needs would preclude postfire salvage logging in those severely burned conifer forests wherein the maintenance of biological diversity is deemed important. ©2006 Society for Conservation Biology.","Black-backed Woodpecker; Cavity-nesting birds; Crown fire; Mixed-severity fire; Picoides arcticus; Salvage logging; Stand-replacement fire",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746338207

Leaving residual live trees in harvested areas is an important component of this strategy. However, the influence of this approach on songbird communities is largely unknown. We surveyed songbirds in 166 stands in the Rocky Mountains in BC, Canada, that had been logged or burned by wildfire. Stands were located in mid or high elevation biogeoclimatic zones, and varied from 7 to 45 years since disturbance and in density of residual trees from 0 to 320 conifer overstory, 0 to 832 conifer understory, and 0 to 68 broadleaf trees/ha. Although differences in bird communities between burned and logged stands of similar ages were detected, these differences were not consistent between biogeoclimatic zones, nor did they explain a large amount of the variation in bird communities. Logged stands had a higher density of birds, but expected species richness did not differ between logged and burned stands. All but a few rare species were detected in both disturbance types. Of 26 species analysed in detail, densities of 14 were greater in logged stands, 6 were greater in burned stands, and 6 were not significantly different between disturbance types. The bird community, bird abundance and densities of individual species were influenced by residual tree density and type. As time since disturbance increased, bird communities in burned and logged stands in the Engelmann Spruce-Subalpine Fir zone became more similar, but those in the Montane Spruce zone became less so, likely due to differences in residual tree density. Results suggest differences in bird communities in logged and burned stands ≥7 years post-disturbance are mainly in abundance rather than community composition, but abundances of individual species can be significantly influenced by residual tree density and type. Managers can influence the abundance of some species in harvested areas by manipulating the type and density of residual trees. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

We asked if current ground layer vegetation composition or stand structure (canopy openness, tree density, plus depth of the soil A layer) in 32 mixed pine-hardwood forest stands at Fort Benning, GA, reflects military use or fire frequency over the last 20 years. The 32 stands, half on sandy and half on clayey soil, were assigned to two military use categories (heavier, open to tracked vehicles, or lighter, with dismounted infantry training) and three fire frequency (# fires/20 yr) categories [low (0-2 fires), medium (3-4 fires), and high (5-6 fires)]. Ordination reflected abundance of grass and legume species, the proportion of pine in the canopy, canopy openness, and tree density and age; it revealed a relatively stronger influence of military land use and canopy composition, and weaker influence of fire frequency (over the past 20 years), on ground layer vegetation differences among the stands. Soil A-horizon depth, abundance of disturbance features, and tree density differed between lighter and heavier military use categories, but not among fire frequency categories. Our results suggest that mechanized military training has led to a loss of topsoil and convergence on abundant pines, grasses, and legumes, while a range of fire frequencies has led to an array of ground layer composition in stands with lighter military use. Under all land use scenarios examined, 70% pine canopy may be favorable for abundant grasses and legumes in ground layer vegetation.","Community dynamics; Military land use; Prescribed fire; Southeastern mixed pine - hardwood forests",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33846081107

Results of hazard (failure) analyses did not show an increased likelihood of large, small, or intense wildfires with an increase in the number of years since the last prescribed fire. Wildfires of various sizes and intensities were more likely to occur in years with lower than average precipitation, regardless of when these areas were last burned. Calculations of expected lightning-fire potential based on weather patterns predicted a peak in lightning-started fires in the early to late summer. Lightning fires were rare, however, and wildfire activity was greatest in the spring and fall. We hypothesize that the ineffectiveness of prescribed burning in reducing wildfire hazard and the low incidence of wildfires in the midsummer in north Mississippi are both artifacts of fire suppression in the past, which converted open oak-pine woodlands with persistent pyrogenic surface fuels that accumulated over time to closed-canopy forests that lack such fuels. We suggest that open canopies and grass-based surface fuels must first be restored before prescribed burning will achieve most desirable management goals in this region, including hazard reduction and ecological restoration of natural fire regimes. © IAWF 2006.","Ecological restoration; Fire management; Fuel management; Lightning; Oak forests; Survival or failure analysis",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33744720676

Their populations have declined, due, in part, to fire suppression and degradation of longleaf pine forests. Populations decline when longleaf stands go more than 3 years without fire. The influence of fire on breeding productivity, however, is poorly understood because territories are large and it is difficult to find the well-hidden nests of this ground-nesting sparrow. In an earlier study, densities of Bachman's Sparrows were similar across pine stands burned 1 to 3 years previously, but declined significantly by the 4th year since burning. To assess whether the decline in density might be associated with a decline in breeding success, in 2001 we used a reproductive index to estimate breeding productivity of 70 territorial males, and from 1999 to 2001 we monitored 28 nests. We examined the influence of (1) season (growing versus dormant) when last burned and (2) years since burning on breeding productivity of Bachman's Sparrows in longleaf pine stands in the Conecuh National Forest, Alabama. Reproductive indices were greater (Z = 1.99, P = 0.047) during the first 3 years after burning (mean = 3.8, SE = 0.4, n = 10) than they were 4 years after burning (mean = 2.0, SE = 0.5, n = 3), similar to the pattern of change in Bachman's Sparrow density. We found no effect of burn season on the breeding productivity index (Z = 0.075. P = 0.94). The parallel patterns of declining density and lower breeding success suggest that Bachman's Sparrow density may be positively correlated with habitat quality.

Prior to the 2001 burning season, 814 active and inactive longleaf pine (Pinus paiustris) cavity trees on Eglin Air Force Base (AFB) in northwest Florida, USA, were prepared via 6 protection methods (combinations of mechanical, hand, and backfiring preparation) and monitored forpostburn survival after 1 year. We collected data on a suite of variables that may be useful in determining cavity tree predisposition to fire-induced mortality. Mortality of protected trees (2.62%) was significantly lower than that of unprotected trees (6.18%), and protection methods did not differ in their effectiveness at preventing mortality. Bark char was significantly more prevalent on unprepared control trees than protected trees, but no differences were apparent among protection treatments. Mechanical clearing alone took the least amount of time and resources; therefore, we determined mechanical clearing to be the most efficient preparation method.

It was therefore hypothesized that in the year following fire, burned forest sites would be colonized by a higher percentage of juvenile birds than intact mature stands. In accordance to this hypothesis, there was a difference in woodpecker age structure between the two habitat types (χ2 = 9.43, df = 2, P = 0.0088, n = 186). However, differences are mainly explained by the higher number of third calendar year birds at burned forest sites, suggesting that a part of the colonization occurs in the same year as the fire by second year birds, rather than by juveniles during the autumn. © Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board 2006.",,Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646692701

Thus, harvesting that is as similar as possible to fire is expected to best maintain natural bird communities. We reviewed studies of birds (mainly grouse, woodpeckers, and songbirds) from boreal forests of western North America and conducted meta-analyses to compare the similarity of bird communities occurring postfire versus postharvest. We compared the bird communities at five seral stages and also summarized the effects of retaining large live trees at harvest. Bird communities immediately postharvest differed greatly from those postfire. Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the period 76-125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest succession during this period influenced bird communities; old aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), old mixedwood, and old white spruce (Picea glauca Moench (Voss)) forests all had different bird communities. Retention of large live trees in cutblocks resulted in their use by many old-forest birds, but results were not consistent among studies.

Location: Camp Whispering Pines (30°41' N; 90°29' W), eastern Louisiana (USA). Methods: We used ecologically sensitive restoration logging to remove patches of Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) in a second-growth loess plain Pinus palustris savanna managed using frequent lightning season fires. Five years later, we measured numbers of vascular plant species and transmitted light in replicated 100-m2 plots. Treatments involved three different overstorey conditions: no overstorey for 5 years, no overstorey for several decades, and overstorey pines present for decades. Results: Both recent and long-term openings contained, on average, about 100 vascular plant species per 100 m2, 20% more than in similar-sized areas beneath overstorey trees. Responses varied with life form; more herbaceous species occurred in recent and older overstorey openings than beneath overstorey trees. Total numbers of all species and of less abundant forb species were positively and linearly related to light transmitted to ground level. Those species responding to openings in the overstorey and positively associated with increased transmitted light levels were monocarpic and short-lived perennial forb and grass species with a seed bank in the soil. In addition, community structure, as reflected in species composition and abundances, appeared to vary with canopy condition. Conclusions: Restoration involving ecologically sensitive removal of patches of overstorey pines in frequently burned pine savannas should benefit the ground cover and increase plant species biodiversity as a result of increased abundance of seed bank species. © IAVS; Opulus Press.","Fire; Longleaf pine; Louisiana; Pinus palustris; Restoration",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646744435

Methods: A review of management paradigms that conserve the high biological diversity and rare species, drawn from characteristics in both second-growth and old-growth stands, is presented for fire-maintained Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) forests. Results: A common assumption that old-growth stands provide the primary information for the development of conservation management strategies de-emphasizes lessons learned from second-growth and restoration studies. Primary conservation management goals for the Pinus palustris ecosystem include the perpetual regeneration of the fire-maintained forest and conservation of the characteristically high biological diversity and rare species. Several attributes, such as a sustained population of Picoides borealis (red-cockaded woodpecker), Aristida stricta (wiregrass)-dominated ground cover, and undisturbed upland-wetland ecotones, can predict a diverse and ecologically functional ecosystem. Such indicators are linked to critical structural and functional features of the system and reflect previous land management histories that suggest sustainable approaches. Conclusions: A traditional definition of 'old-growth' relying on overstorey may be limited in describing important features of healthy, diverse Pinus palustris ecosystems. Some characteristics are significantly more important for maintenance of diversity than age of the trees and these features may be present in old- or second-growth forests. We advocate that the management history, structural characteristics and landscape context of stands that harbour desirable conservation attributes (red-cockaded woodpeckers, wiregrass, gopher tortoises and undisturbed upland-wetland ecotones) can be used as indicators to identify important conservation and forest management principles. © IAVS; Opulus Press.","Adaptive management; Biodiversity; Ecological forestry; Longleaf pine; Old-growth; Prescribed fire; Red cockaded woodpecker; Restoration; Wiregrass",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750346909

The sowing was done at 240 microsites (θ7 cm) in 15 blocks (1×1 m). Treatments were sowing time, watering and sowing shelter. A total of 1463 seedlings emerged on mineral soil and 26 on humus. Watering, covering, their interaction, block and sowing time had significant effects on the number of seedlings. The largest numbers of seedlings were recorded at microsites that were watered and covered. The survival of seedlings was 20% during the growing season and 45% over winter. We conclude that seedbed conditions and moisture are the most essential factors for sexual reproduction of aspen. Short-term weather conditions have an important effect on seedling emergence and are likely to greatly affect field studies. © Springer 2006.","Boreal forest; European aspen; Prescribed burning; Seed ecology; Seedbed conditions; Seedling emergence and survival",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33646537754

Studies have shown that some avian species are much more common in recently burned areas, whereas others are absent. Despite this, we know little about the immediate effect of a large forest fire, and its considerable alteration of habitat, on birds during a single breeding season. In 1995, a 72,000-ha forest fire in our study area gave us the opportunity to assess the effects of fire on reproduction of American kestrels (Falco sparverius) in comparison to an adjacent control area. In addition, we also examined territory occupancy by kestrels in the burned and control areas 8 y following the fire. We found no immediate effect of the fire on body condition of adult kestrels, their ability to hatch eggs, or to fledge at least one young. Birds breeding in the area that burned, however, did fledge fewer offspring per nest, and these nestlings had reduced body mass compared to control nests, possibly because of an immediate reduction in available prey following the fire. Nonetheless, given the profound alteration of habitat following the fire, the fact than any birds remained to continue breeding is remarkable. Territory occupancy of the burned area in 2003 was similar to 1995, the year of the fire, but occupancy in the adjacent control area declined during this period. It therefore appears that the control area is becoming a less suitable habitat for kestrels as the forest continues to mature, whereas the burned area is still providing viable habitat for kestrels. We present evidence suggesting that some of the differences in occupancy between the control and burned area may be due to fewer nest predators in the burned area in 2003.","American kestrels; Boreal forest; Falco sparverius; Forest fires; Prey abundance; Reproductive success; Territory occupancy",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645519976

Little is known, however, about how restoration affects animal populations, especially those of birds. I compared the breeding densities, community structure, and reproductive success of birds in oak savannas maintained by prescribed fire (12 sites) with those in closed-canopy forests (13 sites). All sampling was conducted in Illinois (U.S.A.). Of the 31 bird species analyzed, 12 were more common in savannas, 14 were not affected by habitat structure, and 5 were more common in forest habitat. The species favored by disturbance and restoration included Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), Mourning Doves ( Zenaida macroura), Red-headed Woodpeckers ( Melanerpes erythrocephalus), Indigo Buntings ( Passerina cyanea), and Baltimore Orioles (Icterus galbula). Those more common in closed-canopy forest included Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Wood Thrushes ( Hylocichla mustelina). Few species were unique to one type of habitat, but overall avian community structure in oak savannas and closed-canopy forests was generally distinctive. Estimates of nesting success (derived from 785 nests) revealed that 6 of the 13 species considered experienced greater productivity in the savanna habitat. Rates of brood parasitism were unaffected by restoration and habitat structure. Within savannas, tract size had little effect on breeding abundances and reproductive success. My results illustrate that restoration techniques can significantly affect the ecology of constituent animal populations and communities and have key implications regarding avian conservation and the management of forest habitat in fragmented landscapes. Small patches of forest habitat that regularly function as population sinks may offer far better prospects for birds if they are subjected to disturbance and ecosystem restoration. © 2006 Society for Conservation Biology.","Bird conservation; Disturbance; Fragmentation; Habitat restoration; Nest success; Prescribed fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33645107118

Habitat loss is magnified by fragmentation, which produces edge effects, alters dispersal and natural processes (i.e., fire). We quantified how Florida scrub-jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) habitat varied using traditional landcover maps and methods that considered small focal habitat features (e.g., scrub ridges <2 ha) within an otherwise unsuitable matrix. We collected 7 years of data on color banded Florida scrub-jays to quantify dispersal and investigate how reproductive success and survival varied with habitat potential (scrub ridges), edge effects, and fire history. Landcover maps that identified only large scrub ridges resulted in a potential population of 354 pairs. Including small scrub ridges within an otherwise unsuitable matrix resulted in a potential population >774 pairs. Florida scrub-jays occupied less than half the potential habitat, and their population declined most from disrupted fire regimes. Almost 90% of all breeding dispersers remained within the same cluster of territories that they hatched in emphasizing the need to maximize local habitat quantity and quality. Reduced habitat quality, caused by disrupted fire regimes, was a major fragmentation effect that greatly magnified impacts of habitat loss. The disruption of natural processes is seldom identified as a major fragmentation effect, but studies worldwide have accumulated to demonstrate its significance.

Soil moisture during the growing season influences where it grows and its growth rates; it can tolerate poor drainage but not droughty, hot sites. Due to its tolerance of wet soil conditions, alder is common in riparian areas. Alder can be injured by spring and fall frosts and is not found at elevations above 1100 m anywhere in its range. The species produces small, very light seeds that disperse over long distances; it is favored by disturbance and often increases in abundance after logging or burning. Alder establishment via seed is not assured, however, as drought and heat injury, pathogens, animals and other factors often destroy seedlings. Alder has nitrogen-fixing nodules on its roots that directly and indirectly increase nitrogen in forest ecosystems. Alder usually has a spreading fibrous root system when young and can root deeply if soil aeration is not limiting. When grown in dense stands, its shade intolerance results in rapid mortality of shaded stems and lower branches. It is a relatively short-lived, intolerant pioneer with rapid juvenile growth. This pattern of height growth - very rapid when young and slowing quickly at a relatively young age - means that if thinning is delayed, alder can not rapidly build crown and increase in diameter growth. Although alder wood stains and decays rapidly after death, live trees compartmentalize decay very efficiently, and pruning and thinning are feasible operations. Stem rots do not result in high volumes of damage overall but can be locally important; ring shake can also be a serious problem in some stands. Insects and diseases are not generally a problem in young stands although insect defoliators, Nectria cankers, and alder bark beetles can cause problems. Meadow mice, voles, and beaver can also hinder stand establishment in some areas. Deer or elk may rub small alder saplings during the fall with their antlers but do not usually browse its leaves and twigs. Sapsucker damage is sporadic, but if stems are repeatedly damaged, their future log value will be greatly reduced. Mortality and top damage have been observed after ice or early snowstorms. Red alder is now being managed for a wider range of objectives and on many more sites than in the past; this is due to recent increases in wood value of alder relative to other species as well as its ability to fill specialized niches (e.g., add nitrogen to forest ecosystems, immunity to laminated root rot) and produce sawlogs on relatively short rotations. Management experience with the species, however, is still limited to a fairly narrow range of sites and management scenarios. Thus, information on the biology and ecology of the species should help guide managers until more direct experience is available.","Alnus rubra; Biology; Damaging agents; Ecology; Growth; Red alder; Regeneration",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33746144761

Box 700, New Ellenton, SC 29809, United States","Prescribed burning is used as a restoration and management technique in many deciduous forests of eastern North America. The effects of fire have been studied on habitat selection of many vertebrate species, but no studies have reported the effect of fire on bat roosting habitat. Fire initially leads to an influx of dead and dying trees, an increase of light availability, and a decrease of canopy and sub-canopy tree density. These characteristics are beneficial to many forest-dwelling vertebrates including cavity-roosting bats. We evaluated evening bat (Nycticeius humeralis) roost-site selection at the stand-scale in order to determine roosting preferences as they relate to prescribed burning. Standard radiotelemetry techniques were used to locate evening bat roost trees. Canopy light penetration and overstory tree density were measured in both burned and unburned forests. Sixty-three trees used as roosts by both male and female evening bats were located during both the summer and winter and all 63 roosts were located in the burned portion of the study area. Canopy light penetration was higher and canopy tree density was lower in the burned forest than unburned forest. An increase in light availability may release bats from one of the constraints suggested for many forest-dwelling bat species in roost tree selection - sun-exposure. This should increase the abundance of trees with characteristics suitable for roosting and may allow bats to roost throughout the interior of the forest as opposed to only on forest edges, thereby allowing bats to roost closer to foraging grounds and possibly lessening predation rates. Lower tree density may allow for ease of flight within the forest as well as more efficient locating of roost trees. In addition, there were a significantly higher proportion of dead trees, which evening bats commonly use as roost trees, in burned forests compared to unburned forests. Prescribed burning appears to initially lead to creation or restoration of favorable cavity-dwelling bat habitat and its continual implementation perpetuates an open sub-canopy. Therefore, we suggest that prescribed burning may be a suitable tool for management of roosting habitat for cavity-roosting bats. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Logging, fire, fox (Vulpes vulpes) control and forest fragmentation were investigated in relation to the relative abundance of ngwayir at 90 sites within an area of 285,000 ha east of Manjimup; the location of the last remaining substantial population of ngwayir in jarrah forest. Overall, ngwayir abundance was greatest in areas with limited anthropogenic disturbance. At the local-scale, ngwayir abundance was negatively associated with greater fire intensity. At the landscape-scale, it was positively associated with fox control and negatively associated with forest fragmentation and distance from non-remnant vegetation (i.e., agriculture and tree plantations). Abundance was also greatest in predominantly unlogged landscapes and in forests that had been regrowing for an average of 40 years since the landscape was most recently logged, in other words, where logging was historically least intense. Interactions between fox control efforts and forest fragmentation were also important. This study emphasises the importance of conducting research at appropriate spatial scales and to account for the synergistic effects of the causes of decline. An adaptive management approach to the mitigation of the agents of decline is recommended. Indirect evidence indicates that high value habitat for ngwayir has in all likelihood been selectively cleared for agriculture, owing to its fertile and productive nature. Habitat loss is, therefore, also likely to be a major cause of the modern decline of the species. While many jarrah forest areas that support remaining high abundances of the ngwayir have been incorporated into reserves, conservation of ngwayir habitat and populations outside reserves also will be essential for the recovery and long-term viability of the species. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of repeated fires on snag densities in ponderosa pine forests of the southwestern USA have not been studied. Line intercept sampling was used to estimate snag densities in areas of the Gila Wilderness that had burned one to three times under Wildland Fire Use for Resource Benefit (WFU), a fire management policy implemented since 1974 aimed at restoring natural fire regimes. Twenty randomly located transects were measured in areas burned since 1946; six in once-burned areas, six in twice-burned areas and eight in thrice-burned areas. The mean density ± standard errors of large (>47.5 cm dbh) snags for areas that burned once, twice and thrice was 7.0 ± 2.7, 4.4 ± 1.1 and 4.1 ± 1.3 snags/ha, respectively. Differences in snag densities between once- and multiple-burned areas were significant (F-test; p < 0.05). There was no significant difference in density of large snags between twice- and thrice-burned areas. Proportions of type 1 snags (recently created) were higher in once- and twice-burned areas than in areas that burned three times, likely reflecting high tree mortality and snag recruitment resulting from an initial entry fire. Type 3 snags (charred by previous fire) were more abundant in areas that burned multiple times. The lack of differences in snag densities between areas that burned two and three times suggests that repeated fires leave many snags standing. The increasing proportion of type 3 snags with repeated fires supports this conclusion. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

Study sites were classified into two treatments: fire-intense (areas experiencing growing-season burns) and fire-suppressed (areas lacking fires). Within each treatment, bird and vegetation data were recorded at point-count stations positioned at three distances from streamhead pocosins to characterize the riparian-upland habitat gradient: 0, 75, and ≥150 m. Total bird abundance and species richness varied significantly along the riparian-upland gradient, with pocosins contributing greatly to avian biodiversity. Our data revealed strong effects of fire history and riparian-upland gradient on bird species, which we described in terms of breeding-bird assemblages. Members of the open longleaf assemblage (e.g., Red-cockaded Woodpecker [Picoides borealis], Bachman's Sparrow [Aimophila aestivalis]) were most common in fire-intense areas and at upland locations. Members of the fire-suppressed assemblage (e.g., Wood Thrush [Hylocichla mustelina], Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapilla]) were confined to pocosins in fire-intense areas, but became more abundant in fire-suppressed areas. Members of the pocosin assemblage (e.g., Eastern Towhee [Pipilo erythropthalamus], Common Yellowthroat [Geothlypis trichas]) were largely confined to pocosins and, in some cases, were most abundant in fire-intense pocosins. Fire suppression increased structural diversity of vegetation and promoted one breeding-bird assemblage (fire-suppressed), but at the expense of two others (open longleaf, pocosin). Continued management of Fort Bragg to promote longleaf pine restoration is essential for supporting conservation of the open-longleaf bird assemblage; in addition, it will benefit the pocosin assemblage. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2006.","Breeding birds; Fire; Longleaf pine; Pinus palustris; Riparian habitat",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33750458036

The cross timbers, an upland oak forest that spans an area from Texas to Missouri, developed with frequent fire, but removal of fire since European settlement has increased canopy cover of dominant overstory trees. To assess response of woody plant species cover and plant community compositional trajectories to brush treatments that included herbicides and fire in the cross timbers, we analyzed a 20-year data set (1982-2001) from untreated pastures, pastures treated with tebuthiuron or triclopyr in 1983, and pastures treated with tebuthiuron or triclopyr in 1983 and burned periodically thereafter (tebuthiuron + fire and triclopyr + fire). We used analysis of variance to determine change in overstory canopy cover and understory canopy cover in response to experimental treatment, and we used detrended correspondence analysis to assess trajectories of species composition over time. Overstory canopy cover was reduced from more than 100% to less than 20% following initial herbicide application, but canopy cover increased subsequently to over 60% as herbicide-resistant woody species increased in all but the tebuthiuron + fire treatment. The most striking change in overstory occurred in the tebuthiuron + fire pastures, which contained almost 20% cover of sumac (Rhus spp.) by 1994, and in the tebuthiuron pastures, which contained > 40% cover of eastern redcedar (Juniperus virginiana L.) by 1994. Tebuthiuron, both with and without fire as a follow-up, influenced composition of the overstory more than did triclopyr. Application of tebuthiuron appears to be a long-term unidirectional disturbance in the cross timbers. Composition also remained distinct from pretreatment condition in triclopyr-treated pastures after almost 20 years of postherbicide succession. In contrast, the understory woody plant community was quite resilient to both herbicides.","Brush control; Brush management; Prescribed fire; Quercus marilandica; Quercus stellata; Tebuthiuron; Triclopyr; Upland hardwood forest",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33749168151

A mismatch distribution and calculation of Tajima's D indicate that the overall phylogeographic history of the species is characterized by a recent range expansion that probably occurred after the start of the Pleistocene. In addition, a nested clade phylogeographic analysis indicates that additional processes such as allopatric fragmentation and restricted gene flow have influenced the evolutionary history of this species. Traditionally, the White-headed Woodpecker has been split into two subspecies whose distributions meet in the northern part of the Transverse Ranges in California. The two subspecies differ morphologically, with the southern subspecies having a larger bill in proportion to its body size than the northern subspecies. Geographical variation in mtDNA is concordant with a division at the Transverse Ranges that corresponds to the morphological variation seen between the two subspecies. An analysis of molecular variance indicates that 27% of the genetic variation results from differences between the northern and southern subspecies. Furthermore, birds in the northern part of the range differ from those in the southern part of the range by at least one base substitution. These results agree with the hypothesis that the larger bill of the southern subspecies is the result of recent local adaptation to feeding on the large cones of Coulter pines (Pinus coulteri). © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2006.","Bill morphology; Evolutionarily significant unit; Nested clade phylogeographic analysis; Phylogeography; Picoides albolarvatus; Subspecies; White-headed Woodpecker",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748050443

In southern Sweden, human impacts have decreased densities of old (>150 years) living trees and large (DBH>40cm) dead trees to less than 1% of their original densities. In the same fashion, forest fires have decreased enormously in extent during the last 300 years, except in southwestern Sweden where the original fire frequency was presumably lower. These changes have had a tremendous impact on forest biodiversity. The number of extinctions in Sweden increases rapidly from the north to the south both for forest living species and other species. The number of threatened species shows a similar pattern and it is probable that many of these species belong to the extinction debt, especially those species that are dependent on sun-exposed old living and dead deciduous trees. Rapid restoration measures, such as increasing the number of old sun exposed oaks and large dead deciduous trees in the vicinity of existing hot-spots, may prevent some impending extinctions. Fire is important to use when managing forests for preserving biodiversity, especially in areas where fires more recently have been suppressed and where a relict fire-adapted fauna is still present. © 2005 by The Haworth Press, Inc.

Wildfires can increase or decrease the availability of snags to wildlife by killing live trees or incinerating snags. Our objectives were to describe dynamics and spatial patterns of fire-killed snags in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona and predict the probability of snag use by cavity nesters. We established six 1-ha plots following two recent fires that occurred in northern Arizona (Hochderffer fire of 1996 [H96] and Pumpkin fire of 2000 [P00]) to determine ponderosa pine snag availability and use by wildlife as evidenced by presence of excavated cavities. For comparison, six paired 1-ha plots in nearby unburned areas were sampled with burned plots. For the twelve 1 ha plots, field methods included mapping and measuring 15 characteristics for 668 snags (630 in burned and 38 in unburned plots) 4 years post-fire on the H96 fire, and 1010 snags (996 in burned and 14 in unburned plots) 1 year post-fire on the P00 fire. We remeasured characteristics of all snags in 2003. Most burned snags were standing 3 years after fire, but 7 years after fire, 41% had fallen. Snags in burned plots were clumped when initially measured and remeasured. After 7 years, snags in burned plots that were still standing were straight, large diameter trees in denser clumps. Density of excavated cavities was similar between burned (3.0 ha-1) and unburned (2.2 ha-1) plots, even though burned areas produced much higher densities of snags. Snags (both burned and unburned) that were most likely to contain excavated cavities were large diameter with broken tops. This evidence of cavity nester use indicates that in ponderosa pine forests in the southwest, retaining large diameter snags is important to cavity nesters regardless of snag origin. If salvage logging is to occur in severely burned ponderosa pine in the southwest, retaining straight, large diameter snags in clumps will help maintain snags for cavity-excavating species. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

However, fire management in this region is based primarily on studies of low-elevation ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests maintained largely by frequent understory fires. In contrast to both of these trends, most Rocky Mountain forests are subject to mixed severity fire regimes. As a result, our knowledge of bird responses to fire in the region is incomplete and skewed toward ponderosa pine forests. Research in recent large wildfires across the Rocky Mountains indicates that large burns support diverse avifauna. In the absence of controlled studies of bird responses to fire, we compared reproductive success for six cavity-nesting species using results from studies in burned and unburned habitats. Birds in ponderosa pine forests burned by stand-replacement fire tended to have higher nest success than individuals of the same species in unburned habitats, but unburned areas are needed to serve species dependent upon live woody vegetation, especially foliage gleaners. Over the last century, fire suppression, livestock grazing, and logging altered the structure and composition of many low-elevation forests, leading to larger and more severe burns. In higher elevation forests, changes have been less marked. Traditional low-severity prescribed fire is not likely to replicate historical conditions in these mixed or high-severity fire regimes, which include many mixed coniferous forests and all lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) and spruce-fir (Picea-Abies) forests. We suggest four research priorities: (1) the effects of fire severity and patch size on species' responses to fire, (2) the possibility that postfire forests are ephemeral sources for some bird species, (3) the effect of salvage logging prescriptions on bird communities, and (4) experiments that illustrate bird responses to prescribed fire and other forest restoration methods. This research is urgent if we are to develop fire management strategies that reduce fire risk and maintain habitat for avifauna and other wildlife of the Rocky Mountains.","Coniferous forests; Fire management; Fire regimes; Passerine birds; U.S. Rocky Mountains; Woodpeckers",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-24644486052

Pine savannas, especially longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), that were dominant over much of the upland coastal plain, have declined by approximately 97% over the past 100 yr. The inferred natural fire regime of this vegetation type was a fire frequency of 2-8 yr with typically low-severity fires that occurred during the lightning season (June-August). Currently, dormant-season (January through April) fires are used most frequently. Approximately 110-120 species, excluding migrants, comprise the avian community of southeastern pine savannas; and some of these are among the most rapidly declining bird species in the eastern United States. Disruption of the natural fire regime by fire exclusion or lengthened fire interval was detrimental to bird species associated with tree (e.g., Red-cockaded Woodpecker [Picoides borealis] and ground cover components (e.g., Bachman's Sparrow [Aimophila aestivalis] of the ecosystem. Lightning-season fire has mixed effects on birds (e.g., loss of some nests, but improved brood habitat); therefore, creation of patches of different burn treatments should be carefully considered. The foremost management and conservation challenge is to increase the number of acres of southeastern pine savannas burned frequently through thoughtful application of prescribed burning. Important research challenges include measuring tradeoffs among bird species and other wildlife for different fire regimes, evaluating metapopulation effects of different landscape applications of fire, and considering the nutrient dynamics of different fire regimes on bird populations.","Birds; Fire; Longleaf pine; Prairie; Southeastern United States",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-24644463256

H3C 3P8, Canada","We compared how bird communities differed between burned and logged stands in black spruce (Picea mariana) forests of the boreal shield in Quebec and mixed-wood forests on the boreal plain in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Bird community composition was quite different in burns and clearcuts shortly after disturbance. In burns, cavity nesters and species that forage on beetles in dead trees predominated, whereas clearcuts were dominated by open-country species. Generally, snag-dependent species decreased and shrub-breeding species increased by 25 yr postfire. Species that forage and nest in canopy trees were more common 25 yr postlogging because of the retention of live residual trees. The bird communities tended to converge over time as the vegetation in burns and logged areas became more similar. Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) and Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactylus) exploit recently burned coniferous forest to forage on woodboring insect larvae (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) and bark beetle larvae (Scolytidae) for a short period after fire and then decline. Black-backs were absent from mature forests and found at low density in old-growth forest. Over the long term, burns may be temporary sources for fire specialists. The major conservation issue for fire- associated species is salvage logging, because woodpecker foraging and nesting trees are removed. Maintenance of suitable amounts of postfire forests spared from salvage logging is essential for sustainable forest management. Climate change is predicted to alter fire cycles: they will be shorter in the prairies leading to a shortage of old-growth forest and will be longer in Quebec leading to a shortage of younger forest.","Bird communities; Black-backed Woodpeckers; Boreal forest; Burns; Clearcutting; Even-age forest management; Forest fire; Logging; Picoides arcticus",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-24644470538

The EMEND (Ecosystem Management by Emulating Natural Disturbance) project is a multidisciplinary experiment to compare clearcuts and partial-retention cuts in four upland cover types with uncut forest and with experimentally burned stands. We studied breeding birds at EMEND between 1998 (pretreatment) and 2000, focusing on their responses to partial harvesting. Partial cuts were generally intermediate (and varied in a linear fashion) between clearcuts and undisturbed forest for community and species measures. Species that declined in abundance in partial cuts were typically dependent on shrubs and trees, whereas species that benefited were typically ground nesters. While partial cutting offered some advantages over clear-cutting in conserving short-term avian diversity, we suggest that low retention levels (i.e., 10%, 20%) cannot be justified from this perspective. The benefits that accrued in these treatments were relatively small, and species that declined or disappeared were typically characteristic of mature forest habitats. Higher retention levels (i.e., 50%, 75%) may conserve some species of concern, but the extent to which these treatments offer productivity advantages over lower residuals requires further study. © 2005 NRC.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-27744523555

Frequent low- to moderate-intensity surface fires ignited by both lightning and native Americans sustained open diverse stands in a fire climax and prevented succession to mixed hardwood forests. Disruption of pre-historical and historical fire regimes, coupled with land conversion, urbanization, and other factors, is responsible for the rapid decline of the ecosystem. Today only about 1.2 million ha remain, much in isolated fragments. Primarily because of habitat loss, many animal and plant species associated with longleaf forests are now rare or in decline. Restoration ecologists and managers face a daunting challenge - recreating an ecosystem, in the face of chronic cumulative stress from human activities, that varied widely over temporal and spatial scales. Key restoration factors include: (1) development of a general understanding of the historical condition of the longleaf ecosystem, especially unusual or unique communities and habitats embedded in the general fabric of the larger ecosystem, (2) initiation and expansion of a fire regime, where feasible, similar to that which historically shaped the ecosystem, (3) maintenance/enhancement of herbaceous diversity, (4) continued research on habitat requirements and distribution of rare species, and (5) encouragement of a multi-owner partnership approach to promote conservation across the landscape. Landowners and the public must be educated about the values of the longleaf pine-grassland ecosystem and develop a conservation ethic that considers aesthetics, wildlife, and biodiversity, in addition to economics, if the ecosystem is to be restored. Most forestry practices used to manage and restore longleaf forests are of low short-term risk to rare species in this ecosystem.

At the species level, the relationship was explored between habitat breadth, distribution extent and the ability to occupy recently burned areas. Location: Iberia and Southern France Methods: Fieldwork and bibliography were assembled to obtain breeding bird inventories for 21 burned areas, mostly large wildfires (135- 23,800 ha). The sampling effort was standardized in relation to the area in the 11 fire locations surveyed using transects. Results: Single burned areas contained 0 to 15 open-habitat species (mean = 7.6), and in all the areas combined there were 22 species, including 17 with an unfavourable conservation status in Europe. The most frequent were Carduelis cannabina, Lullula arborea, Alectoris rufa, Oenanthe hispanica and Emberiza cia, but characteristic steppe-land birds such as O. leucura, Calandrella brachydactyla and C. rufescens also bred in particular burned areas. After controlling for the extent of the species range in the Spanish distribution Atlas, passerine occurrence in burned areas was positively related to the species' habitat breadth in a gradient of unburned habitats. Cluster analysis separated a species-poor group of fire locations from a species-rich group, and showed that some neighbouring areas had a similar species composition. However, there was no spatial autocorrelation between burned areas, and species composition was correlated with the fire extent (Mantel test). Species richness tended to increase with increasing fire area. From the regression equation 5, 9, 12-13 and 16-17 open-habitat species may be expected to occur in burned areas of 100, 1000, 10,000 and 100,000 ha, respectively. Conclusions: This study stresses the importance of biogeographical constraints on colonisation of new habitat patches created by disturbances. The extent of the fire rather than the proximity between burned areas influenced species richness and composition of open-habitat birds in recently burned areas. The best post-fire colonisers were generalists regarding habitat structure. The role of large wildfires in the conservation of threatened open-habitat birds seems to be significant and merits further study.","Biogeography; Colonisation; Conservation; Fire; Passerines; Species-area relationship; W Mediterranean",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-27744435376

This material serves both as potential fuel for forest fires and habitat for a large array of forest species. Managers must balance fuel reduction to reduce wildfire hazard with fuel retention targets to maintain other forest functions. This study reports fuel consumption and changes to coarse woody debris attributes with prescribed burns ignited under different fuel moisture conditions. Replicated early season burn, late season burn, and unburned control plots were established in old-growth mixed conifer forest in Sequoia National Park that had not experienced fire for more than 120 years. Early season burns were ignited during June 2002 when fuels were relatively moist, and late season burns were ignited during September/October 2001 when fuels were dry. Fuel loading and coarse woody debris abundance, cover, volume, and mass were evaluated prior to and after the burns. While both types of burns reduced fuel loading, early season burns consumed significantly less of the total dead and down organic matter than late season burns (67% versus 88%). This difference in fuel consumption between burning treatments was significant for most all woody fuel components evaluated, plus the litter and duff layers. Many logs were not entirely consumed - therefore the number of logs was not significantly changed by fire - but burning did reduce log length, cover, volume, and mass. Log cover, volume, and mass were reduced to a lesser extent by early season burns than late season burns, as a result of higher wood moisture levels. Early season burns also spread over less of the ground surface within the burn perimeter (73%) than late season burns (88%), and were significantly patchier. Organic material remaining after a fire can dam sediments and reduce erosion, while unburned patches may help mitigate the impact of fire on fire-sensitive species by creating refugia from which these species can recolonize burned areas. Early season burns may be an effective means of moderating potential ecosystem damage when treating heavy and/or continuous fuels resulting from long periods of fire exclusion, if burning during this season is not detrimental to other forest functions. © 2005 Elsevier B.V.

To facilitate development of conservation strategies, we used DNA sequences and RAPDs (random amplified polymorphic DNA) to examine differences among populations of this species. Phylogenetic analyses of cytochrome b revealed a clade of haplotypes from populations north of the Columbia River derived from a clade containing haplotypes from the river's southwestern region. Haplotypes from southeastern populations formed a separate clade. Nucleotide diversity was reduced in northern populations relative to southern populations. These results were corroborated by analyses of RAPD loci, which revealed similar patterns of clustering and diversity. Network analyses suggested that northern populations were colonized following a range expansion mediated by individuals from populations located southwest of the river. Changes in the Columbia River's location during the Pliocene and Pleistocene likely released distributional constraints on this species, permitting their northern range expansion. Based on the barrier presented by the Columbia River's present location and differences in haplotype diversity and population structure observed between northern and southern populations, we suggest that designation of separate management units encompassing each region may assist with mitigating different threats to this species. © 2005 NRC Canada.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-22744457858

On the basis of grid mapping and using the canonical correspondence analysis, which combines complex data on all bird species and data on the environment, it was possible to show that breeding bird communities are better suited to indicate differences in the structure of deciduous woods than wintering bird communities. Characteristic species of open stands during the breeding season (Fig. 7) are Tree Pipit Anthus trivialis, Garden Warbler Sylvia borin, Common Cuckoo Cuculus canorus, Turtle Dove Streptopelia turtur, Wryneck Jynx torquilla and Hedge Accentor Prunella modularis. Species of two layer stands are Golden Oriole Oriolus oriolus, Grey-headed Woodpecker Picus canus, Fieldfare Turdus pilaris, Yellowhammer Emberiza citrinella, Common Chiffichaff Phylloscopus collybita and Willow Warbler P. trochilus. Characteristic species of staggered oakwoods mixed with coniferous trees are Goldcrest Regulus regulus, Firecrest R. ignicapillus, Coal Tit Parus ater and Common Crossbill Loxia curvirostra, usually typical for conifer woods, and Wren Troglodytes troglodytes.

Further proof for the indicator function of different bird species could be achieved by a species-indicator-analysis (Table 3). Beside the Middle Spotted Woodpecker, the Collared Flycatcher Ficedula albicollis is the second important target species of conservation management in oak woods. Multivariate analysis resulted in only a minor function of this species, but there was a strong correlation for this species to occur in woods with a high proportion of dead branches in crowns of live oaks (Fig.8).","Bird communities; Canonical correspondence analysis; Coppice-with-standards; Dendrocopos medius; Ficedula albicollis; Forest structure; Germany; Indicator species; Oak forests",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-15944411764

Bird surveys were started in 1996 on two burned and two unburned sections of the park to determine what effects the burning and subsequent changes in vegetation were having on bird populations. Birds were sampled at 17 60-m radius point counts on each study area; each point was sampled twice per year during the main breeding period from 1996 through 2002. Total abundance and species richness differed among the four areas but no differences could be attributed to burning. Some individual species, however, differed in abundance and frequency of occurrence between burned and unburned areas. For example, Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Kentucky Warbler (Oporornis formosus), and several species of woodpeckers were more abundant on burned areas; Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorous), Wood Thrush (Hylocicla mustelina) and Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) were among the species more abundant on unburned areas. As a consequence, overall community composition differed significantly between burned and unburned areas of the park, but did not differ between burned areas or between unburned areas. Prescribed burning was instituted to restore vegetation to presettlement conditions and has started to achieve that objective. Restoration also has affected and likely will continue to affect bird populations. Future maintenance of a full complement of bird species, including a number of neotropical migrants, will be dependent on presence of both burned and unburned forest habitat. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We took advantage of a unique opportunity to use a before-after/control-impact (BACI) approach to analyze changes in bird assemblages after the severe fires of 2000 in the Bitterroot Valley, Montana. Observers surveyed birds using 10-minute point counts and collected vegetation data from 13 burned and 13 unburned transects for five years before fire and three years after fire. We compared changes in vegetation variables and relative bird abundance from before to after fire between the set of points that burned and the set of points that did not burn. The magnitude of change in vegetation variables from before to after fire increased with fire severity. The relative abundances of nine bird species showed significantly greater changes from before to after fire at burned points compared with unburned points. Moreover, when burned points were separated by whether they burned at low, moderate, or high severity, an additional 10 species showed significant changes in relative abundance from before to after fire at one or more severities. Overall, almost twice as many bird species increased as decreased significantly in response to fire. We also found changes in abundance between one year after and two years after fire for most species that responded to fire. Thus, species that have been termed ""mixed responders"" in the literature appear to be responding differently to different fire severities or different time periods since fire, rather than responding variably to the same fire conditions. These findings underscore the importance of fire severity and time since fire and imply that both factors must be considered to understand the complexities of fire effects on biological communities. Because different bird species responded positively to different fire severities, our results suggest a need to manage public lands for the maintenance of all kinds of fires, not just the low-severity, understory burns that dominate most discussions revolving around the use of fire in forest restoration. © 2005 by the Ecological Society of America.","Avian communities; BACI approach; Before-after comparison; Bird abundance; Conifer forest; Fire effects; Fire severity; Mixed-severity fire; Northern Rocky Mountains; Wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-26044475582

The stage of stand development coupled with prior management dictates the amount and composition of potential fuels. Thus, fire policy exerts a strong influence on fire effects. Changes in cultural acceptance and use of fire typically drive fire policy. This linkage is perhaps exemplified by America's 300 year love/hate relationship with this powerful natural force. This article uses the four stages of stand development (stand initiation, stem exclusion, understory reinitiation and old-growth), as described by Oliver and Larson (1996), to present opportunities and constraints to fire use, and management options are suggested. Using a selective review of research in the USA that emphasizes the longleaf pine ecosystem in the south-east, the focus is on three themes presented from the viewpoint of a resource manager trying to attain a specific result. First, some high points in the history of fire in America and its ecological ramifications on the landscape are outlined, using examples to illustrate key concepts of behavior, intensity and periodicity. Secondly, examples are given of how people have sought to exclude fire from the landscape, often with disastrous consequences. Thirdly, the topic of prescribed fire in an ecosystem maintenance and restoration role is touched on. Some challenges associated with reintroducing fire into areas where past fire policy dictated its exclusion are also related. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Fire behavior; Fire effects; Fire policy; Longleaf pine; Restoration; Stand dynamics; Suppression",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-27844606900

We used a stochastic simulation model of fire processes to estimate the mean fire-return interval that would maximize stand structural diversity. We investigated trade-offs between structural diversity and temporal population stability associated with changes in the fire interval and used a deterministic version of the model to explore the effects of scheduling fires at fixed intervals. In stochastic simulations, maximum structural diversity occurred at intermediate levels of disturbance (40-year mean fire interval). When fires were scheduled affixed intervals, a longer, 100-year return interval maximized diversity. Mean fire-return interval was a mitigating factor in the diversity-stability relationship, which changed from positive to negative as the fire interval was reduced progressively from 250 to 5 years. As an alternative to scheduling fires at specified mean intervals, we developed a goal-programming model (a form of linear programming model) and used it to identify an optimal fire schedule for achieving habitat and visual-quality objectives. In comparison with the 40-year stochastic mean fire interval, which maximized structural diversity, the optimal schedule produced comparable levels of both diversity and fire frequency. Our results show how simulation and goal-programming models can be used to evaluate prescribed fire-scheduling alternatives and to explore the comparative advantages of natural and optimal fire-management approaches.","Decision analysis; Disturbance; Optimization; Prescribed fire; Simulation",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-10644263722

Sciences, United States","In the southern United States, herbicide use continues to increase for timber management in commercial pine (Pinus spp.) plantations, for modifying wildlife habitats, and for invasive plant control. Several studies have reported that single applications of forestry herbicides at stand initiation have minor and temporary impacts on plant communities and wildlife habitat conditions, with some reports of enhanced habitat conditions for both game and nongame species. Due to the high resiliency of floral communities, plant species richness and diversity rebound rapidly after single herbicide treatments, with short- and long-term compositional shifts according to the selectivity and efficacy of the herbicide used. Recently, however, a shift to the Southeast in North American timber supplies has resulted in increased forest management intensity. Current site-preparation techniques rely on herbicide combinations, often coupled with mechanical treatments and ≥1 years of post-planting applications to enhance the spectrum and duration of vegetation control. This near-total control of associated vegetation at establishment and more rapid pine canopy closure, coupled with shortened and repeated rotations, likely will affect plant diversity and wildlife habitat quality. Development of mitigation methods at the stand and landscape levels will be required to minimize vegetative and wildlife impacts while allowing continued improvement in pine productivity. More uncertain are long-term impacts of increasing invasive plant occupation and the projected increase in herbicide use that will be needed to reverse this worsening situation. In addition, the potential of herbicides to meet wildlife management objectives in areas where traditional techniques have high social costs (e.g., prescribed fire) should be fully explored.","Biodiversity; Habitat; Herbicide; Release treatment; Site preparation; Southeast; Wildlife",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-15544387364

A study was initiated in 2002 to investigate the potential impacts of military training noise, primarily high-caliber weapons fire (HCWF), on the behavior of bats. Fort Knox, KY, was selected as the primary installation for conducting field studies. Standard mist-netting procedures and ultrasonic sound detection systems (Anabat II) were used to determine the presence of bats in selected areas. Anabat and thermal infrared (TIR) cameras were used simultaneously to monitor bats subjected to HCWF, rocket fire, machine gun fire, and helicopter noise. Fieldwork in 2002 and 2003 focused on synchronizing military noise, Anabat, and TIR data to assess actual impacts of military noise events on bat behavior. Data were collected before, during, and after firing events at sample sites immediately adjacent to firing ranges and at reference sites. Mist-net and Anabat surveys revealed the presence of 9 bat species. We conducted 89 Anabat surveys at 22 sites and collected 76 hours of TIR video from 9 locations during the survey period. Acoustic surveys of military training noise were conducted at 8 sites, representing over 300 hours of passive sound activity.

Today, less than 1.2 million ha remain. However, over the past 10-15 years, public land managers have begun to restore many longleaf pine forests. More recently incentive programs have prompted reforestation and afforestation programs on nonindustrial private lands. These activities have been facilitated by improved longleaf regeneration technology and by expanded educational and outreach efforts. In the South, there is also a growing trend towards longer rotations due to changes in wood/fiber markets and prices. These trends suggest a new strategy to increase terrestrial carbon storage in the southeastern United States in a way that provides many simultaneous ecological and economic benefits. For example, longleaf pine is a long-lived species with a low mortality rate. Among the southern pine species, it has a high specific gravity and can tolerate a very wide variety of habitats. Longleaf pine is better able to sustain growth at older ages (over 150 years) and is tolerant to fire and many insects and diseases. Recent research also indicates that longleaf pine managed for longer rotations outperforms other commercial southern pine species on most sites and might better adapt to future climate scenarios with higher temperatures and higher atmospheric CO2 levels. Moreover, the higher-value, longer-lasting wood products derived from longleaf pine forests will continue to store carbon over long time periods. © 2004 Springer-Verlag New York, LLC.","Carbon sequestration; Carbon sink; Carbon storage; Longleaf pine; Pinus palustris; Us southern forests",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-27544439147

Treatments were carried out in 45 permanent plots located in two localities with different ombroclimates: semiarid and dry. Two years after treatments were carried out, floristic richness, diversity, life form rates and vegetation cover were measured or estimated for each plot. Results showed a high capability of post-fire colonizing vegetation to rapidly recover the ecological values recorded before carrying out silviculture treatments.

The influence of season (growing vs. dormant) and frequency (1 to ≥4 yr since burning) of fire on density of Bachman's sparrows, however, is poorly understood. We examined effects of fire on density of Bachman's sparrows in longleaf pine forests at the Conecuh National Forest, Alabama, and Blackwater River State Forest, Florida, USA. Density of Bachman's sparrows was greater the first 3 years after burning than ≥4 years after burning, and season of burning had little effect on the density of Bachman's sparrows. Percent coverage by grass had a greater influence on density of Bachman's sparrows than either season or frequency of burning. Percent canopy cover had a strong negative effect on coverage of grass but had a weaker effect on grass at stands burned frequently during the growing season. Growing-season fires (Apr-Sep) did not adversely affect density of Bachman's sparrows. Results from our study suggest that management and restoration of longleaf pine communities probably can be accomplished best by burning on a 2-3-year rotation during the growing season, when most fires historically occurred. Suppression of fire, or burning at intervals >4-5 years, will greatly reduce or eliminate habitat required by Bachman's sparrows.","Aimophila aestivalis; Alabama; Bachman's sparrow; Fire ecology; Florida; Habitat management; Habitat restoration; Longleaf pine ecosystem; Pinus palustris; Prescribed fire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-12144253192

Although current fire management focuses on fuel reductions to bring fuel loadings back to their historical ranges, at the regional scale extreme fire weather is still the dominant influence on area burned and fire severity. Current forecasting tools are limited to short-term predictions of fire weather, but increased understanding of large-scale oceanic and atmospheric patterns in the Pacific Ocean (e.g., El Niño Southern Oscillation, Pacific Decadal Oscillation) may improve our ability to predict climatic variability at seasonal to annual leads. Associations between these quasi-periodic patterns and fire occurrence, though evident in some regions, have been difficult to establish in others. Increased temperature in the future will likely extend fire seasons throughout the western United States, with more fires occurring earlier and later than is currently typical, and will increase the total area burned in some regions. If climatic change increases the amplitude and duration of extreme fire weather, we can expect significant changes in the distribution and abundance of dominant plant species in some ecosystems, which would thus affect habitat of some sensitive plant and animal species. Some species that are sensitive to fire may decline, whereas the distribution and abundance of species favored by fire may be enhanced. The effects of climatic change will partially depend on the extent to which resource management modifies vegetation structure and fuels.","Climatic change; Conservation; Fire history; General circulation models; Wildfire",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-4043136635

We studied the nesting biology of Southeastern American Kestrels in 1999 and 2000 at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, in old-growth longleaf pine savanna, a habitat type historically widely occupied by the kestrels. Most of the nest cavities we observed were in old-growth trees, both living and dead, and were originally excavated by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and then enlarged by other woodpecker species. Nesting success was 70% in 1999 and 56% in 2000. In 1999, 67% of eggs survived to become fledglings in successful nests, as did 58% in 2000. Nests in live pines and snags were equally successful, and nest success was positively related to cavity height in 1999. Reduced nesting success in 2000 may have been related to severe drought conditions. High nesting concentrations of up to 4 pairs per km2 were observed. We suggest that stands of old-growth longleaf pine, with little or no hardwood midstory and a relatively high number of snags, inhabited by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, may constitute high quality habitat for Southeastern American Kestrels. Therefore, loss of longleaf pine habitat, degradation of remaining longleaf habitat due to fire suppression and removal of old-growth and snags, and the decline of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker, a species on which kestrels may have depended as a source of nest cavities historically, may have contributed to the decline of the Southeastern American Kestrel.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-24344474240

For the whitespotted sawyer, Monochamus scutellatus (Say), a fire-associated xylophagous cerambycid, host location and acceptance patterns have been relatively well described, whereas landscape-scale distribution patterns in recently disturbed areas have received virtually no attention. In a 5,097-ha recently burned black spruce forest of Quebec, Canada, we evaluated the variability of larval density of 569 trees in 114 plots, by using entry hole counts. This variability was then related to environmental variables ranging from tree- to landscape-scale. Both diameter at breast height (positive relationship) and fire severity (negative relationship) were significant at explaining larval density at tree scale. At larger scales, altitude had a negative effect on larval density, whereas plots having a higher percentage of unburned forest in a 500-m radius were more intensely colonized. The importance of the proximity of unburned stands could be linked to the feeding requirements of the adults, which should show preference for stands offering both egg-laying and feeding substrata, because several species of Monochamus have been shown to feed while being reproductively active. In our models, large-scale variables explained more variability in entry hole counts than did tree-scale variables. Thus, our results suggest that large-scale habitat location mechanisms may play an important role in the host selection process of the whitespotted sawyer.","Boreal forest; Forest fire; Habitat location; Host selection; Monochamus scutellatus",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-11144233338

The relationship assumed is usually one of woodpecker dependence or preference for partially decayed wood in which to excavate cavities, but the woodpecker is also sometimes suggested as a vector for the fungus. In this paper we review such associations and describe patterns evident among woodpecker nest sites that suggest microclimatic and microhabitat characteristics favoring fungal colonization of trees, woodpecker-favorable responses of trees to fungi, and ultimate use of the trees for woodpecker cavity excavation. Factors that favor fungal invasion and tree use by woodpeckers include tree species, growth history, site characteristics such as proximity to water and exposure to sun or shade, nature and position of tree injury, local climate, forest age and species composition, fire frequency, and human management activities. Woodpecker cavity height and entrance orientation may be related to the dispersal dynamics of fungi, which in turn may be related to forest vegetation, thermal, and hydric characteristics.","Cavity; Fungi; Nest-site correlates; Nest-site selection",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1142281766

However, little is understood about the time frame and the variables affecting occupancy of postfire habitats by these birds. We studied factors influencing the occupancy and reuse of nest cavities from 1-7 years after fire in two burned sites of western Idaho during 1994-1999. Tree cavities were used for nesting by 12 species of cavity nesters that were classified by the original occupant (strong excavator, weak excavator, or nonexcavator) of 385 nest cavities. We used logistic regression to model cavity occupancy by strong excavators (n = 575 trials) and weak excavators (n = 206 trials). Year after fire had the greatest influence on occupancy of nest cavities for both groups, while site of the burn was secondarily important in predicting occupancy by strong excavators and less important for weak excavators. Predicted probability of cavity occupancy was highest during the early years (1-4) after fire, declined over time (5-7 years after fire), and varied by site, with a faster decline in the smaller burned site with a greater mosaic of unburned forest. Closer proximity and greater interspersion of unburned forest (15% unburned) may have allowed a quicker recolonization by nest predators into the smaller burn compared to the larger burn with few patches of unburned forest (4% unburned). In combination with time and space effects, the predicted probability of cavity occupancy was positively affected by tree and nest heights for strong and weak excavators, respectively.","Burned forests; Cavity-nesting birds; Lewis's Woodpecker; Melanerpes lewis; Nesting habitat; Picoides; Pinus ponderosa",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-1142305944

Although hawk owls use burned forest, reports of this association have been primarily anecdotal and outside the breeding season. We present the first comparison of hawk owl relative abundance between burned and unburned conifer-dominated boreal forest in North America. Hawk owls were detected only in postfire forest and were not detected in nearby unburned coniferous forest. There was a significant negative exponential relationship between hawk owl abundance and burn age, suggesting that burns were only suitable up to 8 years post-fire. A conservative estimate of a peak in breeding density was three nests per 100 km2 for a 2-year-postfire forest. Wildfire and newly burned forests may be an important feature for hawk owls in the Nearctic boreal forest. This raises the question whether management of this species through improved forestry techniques is a sufficient conservation measure.","Breeding; Burned forest; Clearcut logging; Fire; Northern Hawk Owl; Surnia ulula",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2342568981

In a bumt area of eastern Finland, where the woodpecker breeding population has been continuously diminishing, following a major increase the first year after fire, only the abundance of spruce bark beetles (Col., Scolytidae) (the woodpecker autumnspring main insect prey) decreased through the years. Conversely, the abundance of longhorn beetles (Col., Cerambycidae) (the nestling main food supply) increased dramatically. On the other hand, in neighbouring old-growth patches where one pair was breeding annually, abundance of spruce bark and longhorn beetles did not change significantly between years, although the abundance level ofthe bark beetles differed among patches. Hence, my results suggest the woodpecker breeding population to be limited by food supply available outside the breeding season, as shown for other forest bird species. The finding, however, that woodpeckers breeding 6-7 years after the fire reared larger broods than earlier pairs, while brood size did not change annually under old-growth conditions, suggests longhorn beetle availability to be critical to reproductive success.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0942280445

Defining tradeoffs when applying prescribed fire to large landscapes is problematic not only because of the complexity of weighing competing management objectives at the landscape scale, but also because of the difficult nature of independently applying need-to-burn criteria to large areas. We present a case study of a simple modeling process implemented at Eglin Air Force Base in the Florida Panhandle (U.S.A.) to prioritize the application of prescribed fire. In a workshop setting, managers and biologists identified key conservation criteria and landscape management objectives that drive the application of prescribed fire. Remote sensing and other spatial data were developed to directly or indirectly represent all these criteria. Using geographic information system software, managers and biologists weighted each criterion according to its relative contribution to overall burn prioritization, and individual values for the criterion were scored according to how they influence the need to burn. Subsequently, this process has been validated and modified through ecological monitoring. This modeling process has also been applied to the 77,400-ha Blackwater River State Forest, public land adjacent to Eglin Air Force Base, demonstrating its applicability to lands with varying management priorities. The advantages of this model-based approach for prioritizing prescribed fire include the reliance on accessible, inexpensive software, the development of spatially explicit management objectives, the ease of transferability, and clearly stated assumptions about management that may be tested and reviewed through monitoring and public comment.","Eglin Air Force Base; Fire management; GIS; Longleaf pine sandhills; Modeling; Prescribed burning; Remote sensing",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346104917

During the spring of 1998 and 1999, 49 plots (of which 40 had been bumed from 0.5 to 5 years ago) were characterised in terms of vegetation structure, surrounding landscape composition and breeding bird populations. Linear regression analysis and ANOVA were used to evaluate the effects of prescribed fire on vegetation and birds. Herbaceous vegetation showed a modal growth with a maximum development ca. 3 years after fire. Shrub development increased linearly with time since fire. Understory vegetation structure 5 years after fire was similar to control plots. Bird abundance and richness were influenced by plot variables (increased with stand age) and landscape variables (decreased with the amount of shrublands and eucalyptus stands surrounding the plot). After controlling for the effect of these variables, time since fire affected bird abundance, particularly for shrub/ground nesters. Minimum abundance occurred in the second or third breeding season after fire, possibly due to site tenacity or increased food availability. Prescribed bums did not affect bird richness. The size of the bumed plots did not affect bird abundance or richness, probably because most burns were very small. Measures to increase bird diversity in these forests include maintaining other tree species and snags, avoiding the use of eucalyptus, and keeping a 5-year interval between consecutive prescribed burns in a given stand. The average size of burns could probably be increased without detrimental effects on bird populations. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

We tested whether prescribed burning affected amphibian abundance and diversity within the Francis Marion National Forest, South Carolina, by monitoring assemblages at 15 temporary ponds with five different burn histories: 0, 1, 3, 5, and 12 years after burns. We also monitored terrestrial and aquatic environmental variables likely to influence amphibian diversity, such as leaf-litter depth, pond water chemistry, and distance to neighboring ponds. Fire had significant negative effects. Immediate effects (burning during the study) explained 12.8% and 10.8% of the variation in anuran and amphibian abundance, respectively, whereas short-term effects explained 31.8% and 24.6% of variation in amphibian species richness and evenness, respectively. Species richness increased and evenness decreased with time since burn, primarily because salamanders were rarely encountered at sites burned within 2 years. These sites had the shallowest leaf litter and highest soil temperature variances. Environmental factors unrelated to burning also significantly influenced amphibian diversity. Water chemistry explained 31.1% of variation in species richness, 32.2% of evenness, and >25% of anuran, salamander, and total amphibian abundances. Salamanders were most sensitive to water chemistry factors, particularly pH. Our results suggest that decreasing the frequency of prescribed burns from the current 2-3 years to 3-7 years will better maintain diverse amphibian and plant assemblages. Substituting growing-season burns for the current practice of winter and spring burns would avoid repeatedly interrupting amphibian breeding and would maintain the desired longleaf pine community. 1339.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0141873083

Maximum pine ages in the two stands exceeded 240 years. Both stands underwent continuous pine recruitment over the past 145 years, with all 5-year age classes represented. Congregations of even-aged pine patches were found throughout both stands. Multiple tree patches ranged from 15 to 170 years old. Large even-aged patches were present in both stands (up to 2124 m2), though isolated single trees were more common, accounting for about half of all patches.

These pines occur in arid and semi-arid foot-hills and mountains of California that are subjected to frequent fires. Cone and seed traits of these three California pines are compared to those of four species of pines (sugar pine, P. lambertiana; Jeffrey pine, P. jeffreyi; ponderosa pine, P. ponderosa; and lodgepole pine, P. contorta) that occur in more mesic environments in the nearby Sierra Nevada mountains. The cones of the Sabinianae pines are large with thick, dense scales, and the scales of gray and Coulter pines are armed with sharp, recurved spines. The seeds of all three species are large, and those of gray and Torrey pines are nearly wingless. In contrast, the Sierra Nevada pines have small to medium-sized seeds with large wings that are initially dispersed by the wind. Heavy wing loading of the Sabinianae pine seeds causes them to fall rapidly, and they are not dispersed far by wind. However, animals remove the fallen seeds rapidly, and rodents and jays scatter hoarded many seeds in the soil. This caching activity results in seedling establishment. The unusual morphology of the cones and seeds of the Sabinianae pines is interpreted as a combination of traits that attract animal dispersers, thwart the foraging activities of seed predators, and promote the survival of seeds in an environment subject to frequent fires.","Evolution of seed dispersal; Fire; Scatter hoarding; Seedling establishment; Serotiny",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0041663716

The effects of prescribed fire on ant community structure were examined in a regenerating longleaf pine savanna in Florida, U.S.A. The presence of ants on 20, 10 × 10 m plots was determined by baiting every 1-3 months from 18 months before a fire until 6 months afterwards. 2. Expected species richness (based on rarefaction) and species density 6 months post-fire were significantly lower than for the same month (September) 6 months before the fire. 3. Cluster analysis revealed that the effects of fire were far less important predictors of ant community structure than seasonality and unexplained interannual variation. Thus, overall, the impacts of fire were relatively minor and short term at the community level. 4. Different functional groups of ants (as defined by Andersen, 1997) responded to fire in strikingly different ways. Generalised Myrmicinae (e.g. Pheidole spp., Monomorium viride) were affected more severely by fire than were the other functional groups. In contrast, the dominant Dolichoderinae (Forelius pruinosus) exhibited a large increase after the fire and seemed to be responsible for the decline in abundance of several species. 5. A strong negative correlation between F. pruinosus and other groups of ants immediately after the fire suggested more intense competition among ants at that time. Six months post-fire, the abundance of F. pruinosus decreased markedly and the abundance of other species rebounded. 6. The rapid post-fire recovery of the ant community probably reflects adaptations of ants to a chronic fire regime.","Ant community; Fire; Functional groups; Longleaf pine; Species density; Species richness",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0042073169

Belt transects (1 to 17 km in length, 4 m width) along 18 foot trails were surveyed for aspen seedlings on the subalpine plateau of the Park, along gradients of elevation and geologic substrate, during the summer of 1996. Aspen seedling presence and density were characterized as a function of elevation, geologic substrate, slope, aspect, vegetation/cover type, presence of burned forest, and distance to nearest adult aspen stand. Presence of aspen seedlings was best predicted by the incidence of burned forest and proximity to adult aspen; aspen seedlings were only found in burned forest and were more likely to occur closer to adult aspen clones. When tested against independent data collected in 1997, the logistic regression model for aspen seedling presence performed well (overall accuracy = 73%, Taup = 0.41). When present, variation in aspen seedling density at local scales (≤ 200 m) was largely explained by elevation, with higher densities observed at lower elevations. At broad scales (> 1 km), seedling density was a function of cover type, elevation, aspect, slope, and burn severity, with greater seedling density in more severely burned forested habitats on southerly, shallow slopes at lower elevations. Aspen seedling densities ranged from 0 to 46,000 seedlings/ha with a median density of 2,000/ha on sites where they occurred. Aspen seedlings were most abundant in the south central and southwest central regions of the park, approximately an order of magnitude less abundant in the southeast region, and nearly absent in the north central area. Establishment of new aspen stands on Yellowstone's subalpine plateau would represent a substantial change in the landscape. However, the long-term fate of these postfire aspen seedlings is not known.","Fire ecology; Landscape ecology; Logistic regression; Northern Rocky Mountains; Population dynamics; Populus tremuloides; Spatial extrapolation; Spatial heterogeneity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038718903

This study examined the diverse ant community found in the longleaf pine flatwoods of north Florida and tested how ant diversity changes along a herbaceous ground cover gradient. Restoring the ground cover to its original floral composition is an important focus of longleaf pine conservation and hence it is important to understand how native faunal communities vary with ground cover variation. Using 4 sampling methods, we characterized the ant community and analyzed its withinhabitat variation among 12 study sites. We found the highest plot species richness (55 species) and within-habitat species richness (72 species) ever recorded for North American ants. The ants formed three distinct communities. The low-diversity arboreal and subterranean assemblages varied little across forest stands while the diversity of the species-rich ground foraging ant community was negatively correlated with percent herbaceous cover. The imported fire ant, Solenopsis invicta (monogyne form), was unexpectedly found to be abundant in high herbaceous cover sites. Floral restoration of the pine flatwoods, which is increasing the proportion of herbaceous cover, is likely to cause an increase in the abundance of the imported fire ant.","Ant community; Conservation biology; Formicidae; Pinus palustris; Solenopsis invicta",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-2942706051

Less than 1% of the original longleaf pine forests remain as old-growth stands. Eglin Air Force Base (Eglin) in northwest Florida contains the largest remaining extent of longleaf pine, but much of this habitat has been degraded through fire suppression, selective logging, and planting off-site species of pines. We examined the distribution of bird species among habitats during spring and fall 1994-1995 to assess the influence of large-scale habitat restoration on bird communities across the landscape. During both spring and fall, species richness and relative abundance of neotropical migrants were greatest in oak hammocks and riparian habitats. During spring, the abundance of resident species was greatest in barrier island scrub and flatwoods, but species richness of residents also was high in oak hammocks. During fall, both species richness and abundance of residents were greatest in oak hammocks and flatwoods. Analyses of abundance for individual species (both neotropical migrants and residents) suggested that each habitat examined was important for ≥1 species. An analysis examining the importance of habitats for conservation found that oak hammocks and riparian habitats were important for species of high management concern, but burned sandhills along with oak hammocks and riparian habitats were very important for species of the greatest management concern. Our results suggest that habitat modifications resulting from restoration of the longleaf pine ecosystem will benefit many species of management concern. Bird species negatively affected by habitat modifications for longleaf pine restoration were abundant in other habitats.","Barrier islands; Bird communities; Gulf Coastal Plain; Longleaf pine restoration; Neotropical migrants; Oak hammocks; Partners in Flight concern scores; Pinus palustris; Prescribed burning; Riparian zones",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038292177

Over the course of 3 years (1998-2000) the authors used line-transect identification surveys in the two regions, Mengsong and Jinuo, where four different habitats were surveyed: 6-year fallow fields; traditional economic forests; monsoon evergreen broadleaf forests; and montane rain forests. Data were analyzed for species diversity, richness (family, genera, species), co-occurrence (family, genera, species), characterization of migratory status and feeding habits. Both of these study areas are inhabited by minority groups (Hani and Jinuo) that employ swidden agriculture as their main form of economic activity. The forest landscape in the Jinuo ethnic region is quickly transforming due to changing agricultural practices, and as a result bird diversity and richness are declining, while the Hani ethnic region (Mengsong), with a stable form of traditional swidden agriculture, is maintaining a high diversity and richness of birds. The greatest differences in bird diversity between the two sites occurred in the traditional economic forests and the 6-year fallow fields where the Hani region had a much greater richness and diversity. The two natural forest types (monsoon evergreen broadleaf forests and montane rain forests) were more similar in richness and diversity and also maintained the greatest richness and diversity of the four forest types analyzed. The transformation of healthy forests into degraded landscapes is one of the major impacts of human activity on the natural environment, which is posing a great threat to biodiversity. This study looks at the bird diversity of the two regions and tries to take into account how humans can extract economic benefits while preserving ecological benefits, such as a landscape that allows biodiversity to thrive. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Control plots were unburned for the same period of time. Pitfall traps were operated from November 1994 to October 1999 to measure the short- and long-term effects of prescribed burning frequency on the relative abundance and diversity of ground-dwelling macroarthropods. We also measured dead and live plant biomass to determine how long-term frequent fires affected the structure of the forest floor. The average total dead plus live plant biomass was significantly higher on plots where fire had been excluded. Annual and biennial burning resulted in about the same amount of total plant biomass (dead and live plant material combined) which was significantly less than the quadrennially burned plots. Shannon diversity (H') and evenness of ground-dwelling arthropods were reduced by burning. Annually burned plots had the lowest diversity and evenness while biennially and quadrennially burned plots also were significantly lower than unburned control plots. Dormant-season burning did not increase the number of rare genera regardless of frequency. Percent similarity of arthropod communities was highest for comparisons between plots that had been burned (60-68%) and lowest for the comparison of annually burned plots to unburned controls (37%). Examination of diversity and similarity through time showed that changes were due to short-term effects caused by the application of fire and not long-term changes in the ground-dwelling arthropod community. Burning significantly reduced the numbers of predators regardless of fire frequency and resulted in an increased number of detritivores. A total of 42 genera were reduced by prescribed burning; 32 genera were captured in greater numbers on annually burned plots, and 11 genera had higher numbers in one or both of the intermediate bum frequencies (biennial or quadrennial). Twenty-six genera were captured in equal numbers on quadrennially and annually burned plots, but in significantly lower numbers than on unburned plots, demonstrating that 4 years was insufficient time for their populations to recover from mild dormant-season fires. Arthropod response to burning appeared to be species specific so attempts to generalize how arthropods will respond based on a few species or groups should be avoided. The slow recovery rate of so many species suggests that management oriented toward conservation of biodiversity in longleaf pine flatwoods should include areas of fire exclusion. © 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.","Arthropods; Fire; Insects; Pinus palustris; Prescribed-burning",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037416124

Our objective was to investigate whether source-sink ideas could be applied to quantify how habitat arrangements influenced Florida Scrub-Jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens) population dynamics, in order to enhance habitat restoration. From 1988 to 2001, we measured reproductive success, survival, immigration, emigration, pair bond fidelity, and the duration of delayed breeding by young. The arrangement of shrub height in each territory was used to classify habitat quality each year, according to the following categories: short (<120 cm tall), optimal (short plus 120-170 cm tall), tall mix (short or optimal and >170 cm), and tall (>170 cm). Annual demographic performance rates were calculated in each territory by summing the recruitment of potential breeders (the number of yearlings produced) and then subtracting the number of breeders that died. The mean demographic performance per breeding pair was -0.57, 0.33, -0.26, and -0.35, respectively, for short, optimal, tall mix, and tall territories. Optimal territories functioned as sources because recruitment exceeded mortality; hence, the optimal territories were net exporters to marginal habitat. Potential breeders were exported to sink territories by active dispersal and by ""territory quality transitions,"" whereby territories produced an excess of potential breeders while in optimal condition and then became marginal because of shifting territory boundaries and habitat conditions. Short, tall mix, and tall territories functioned as sinks because they were net importers, mortality exceeded recruitment, and because there were no density-dependent reductions in their demographic performance. The population declined because there were too few optimal territories to offset declines in sinks, which usually had too much tall scrub even though most of the landscape had been burned recently. Successful habitat restoration requires greater emphases on improving habitat quality at the territory scale because this is the fundamental landscape unit related to demography. Source-sink ideas, complemented by territory quality transitions, provide a quantitative approach to directly relate habitat and demographic objectives.","Aphelocoma coerulescens; Demography; Dispersal; Fire; Florida Scrub-Jay; Habitat suitability; Patch dynamics; Source-sink; Territory quality",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0038376943

A logistic regression model was developed based on the presence or absence of foraging signs. Results showed that Black-backed Woodpeckers used larger snags that were less deteriorated by fire (qualified as high-quality snags). Direct field observations of individuals foraging on 119 snags also indicated that used snags corresponded to those of high predicted quality. Finally, we assessed the relationship between food availability and snag characteristics by measuring the density of wood-boring beetle larvae holes on 30 snags of different size and deterioration classes. High-quality snags contained higher prey densities (wood-boring beetle holes) than smaller and more deteriorated snags.

Numerous studies have examined raccoon space and macrohabitat use, but information detailing these parameters within pine-dominated landscapes is lacking. Furthermore, no studies using radiotracking have examined raccoon habitat use at multiple spatial scales. We radiomonitored 131 adult raccoons (99 M, 32 F) during 1991-1997 in central Mississippi, USA. We subsequently assessed space use and habitat selection at 3 spatial scales. Males maintained larger home ranges and core areas than females. Size of home ranges differed by season, but raccoons maintained similar-size core areas across seasons. Habitat use differed by gender only at the coarsest spatial scale. Raccoons consistently used mature (>30 years old) pine and hardwood habitats over other available habitats at all spatial scales. Although hardwood-dominated habitats were important to raccoons, our findings suggest that in pine-dominated landscapes, raccoons select multiple seral stages of pine. Raccoons also readily used ≤8-year-old pine habitats, likely because of increased foraging opportunities within these habitats, particularly during spring and summer. Our findings illustrate the importance of juxtaposition of habitat types for raccoons in pine-dominated landscapes, specifically the availability of mature pine and hardwood habitats, as well as early-successional habitats capable of providing beneficial foraging resources. Additionally, our findings offer evidence that prescribed burning may alter landscape use by raccoons, providing the potential that manipulating burning frequencies may allow managers to manage raccoon habitat-use patterns.","Compositional analysis; Core-use area; Habitat use; Home range; Mississippi; Movement; Procyon lotor; Raccoon",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037695055

Cavities occurred at higher rates in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa; 28%) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii; 8.4%) snags than in snags of other tree species (≤5%). Few or no cavities were found in large samples (n > 250) of subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa; 0.2%) and lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta; 0.0%) snags.

Cavity-bearing ponderosa pine snags were best characterized as large-diameter (>34 cm diameter at breast height [dbh]) snags >2 m tall and located in middle-age to older burns (>19 years old). Cross-validated accuracy of the classification tree model was 97% for cavity snags and 82% for snags without cavities. Cavity-bearing Douglas-fir snags were best characterized as large-diameter snags (>33 cm dbh), or as smaller soft snags (Class 4, 5) at elevations <1,200 m. Accuracy of the classification tree model was 88% and 73% for snags with and without cavities, respectively. In burns <20 years old, Douglas-fir snags with broken tops had higher cavity excavation rates (6%) than snags with whole tops (0.25%). Aspect, slope, slope position, and elevation had negligible or no value for classification. To ensure good post-fire snag habitat, manage pre-fire green stands for tree species, large size, defect (e.g., broken tops), and spatial pattern that will provide cavity snags in short and long terms.

Tree mortality and insect attacks were measured on 1,367 trees for three years after a spring wildfire (4 May 1996), a summer wildfire (20 June 1996), and a fall prescribed fire (9 September 1995) in northern Arizona. Western pine beetle, Dendroctonus brevicomis LeConte, mountain pine beetle, D. ponderosae Hopkins, roundheaded pine beetle, D. adjunctus Blandford, red turpentine beetle, D. valens LeConte, Ips species, and wood borers in the Buprestidae and Cerambycidae families were found in fire-damaged trees. The most frequently occurring insects, listed from most to least frequent, were wood borers, red turpentine beetle, Ips spp., western pine beetle, roundheaded pine beetle, and mountain pine beetle. Trees attacked by Dendroctonus and Ips spp. as a group had more crown damage from fire than unattacked trees. The percentage of trees attacked by Dendroctonus and Ips species was lowest during the fall fire (11%, 25 of 222 trees), intermediate during the summer fire (19%, 154 of 833 trees), and highest during the spring fire (41%, 127 of 312 trees). More than one-half of all wood borer colonization (58%) and attacks by western pine beetle (68%), roundheaded pine beetle (56%), and Ips spp. (66%) occurred in the first year after the fire. Measures of tree damage from fire and insect attacks were used to develop logistic regression models of tree mortality to quantitatively investigate factors that influenced tree mortality. Tree mortality 3 yr postfire was low until crown damage by fire exceeded 70-80% for unattacked trees, 40-50% for trees with partial attacks by Dendroctonus and Ips species, and 30-40% for trees with mass attacks. We concluded that several Dendroctonus and Ips species colonize fire-damaged ponderosa pines in northern Arizona and colonization is promoted by heavy crown damage from fire.","Dendroctonus; Ips; Logistic regression; Pinus ponderosa; Tree mortality",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0037625260

CBS is the standard silvicultural system in these forests, while fuelwood harvesting, as currently proposed, would involve the recovery of a higher proportion of felled biomass than standard CBS, as well as some pre-existing CWD.Studies and practices from around the world are considered that have relevance to the temperate Australian forestry situation in general, and the Tasmanian situation in particular. The paper considers the ecological roles of CWD in natural forest ecosystems, emphasising its value as a key structural component and as habitat for biodiversity (especially invertebrates). Temporal continuity and spatial connectivity in supply of CWD, and presence of larger-diameter CWD, emerge as key factors determining community richness and composition. Whilst levels of CWD naturally fluctuate spatially and temporally in wet eucalypt forests, studies from northern temperate and boreal forests with similar dynamics demonstrate that, historically, management of native forests has tended to result in a gradual diminution of the CWD resource. Larger-diameter material is readily diminished through management, with potential consequences for dependent biodiversity.Suggested mitigation measures (landscape-level and coupe-level), to accommodate biodiversity concerns and avoid a long-term conservation management problem for forest managers in Tasmania, centre on two main concerns. One is the likelihood that current standard rotation lengths used in CBS are probably too short to allow for the recruitment of sufficient CWD to replace that which is lost through harvesting, regeneration burning and natural decomposition. The other concern is that fuelwood harvesting may significantly increase the impacts of CBS on biodiversity in general and on threatened species in particular. © 2003 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Biodiversity; Clearcutting; Forest fires; Fuelwood; Invertebrates; Logging; Population dynamics; Reviews; Sclerophyllous forests; Tasmania; Wood residues",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0347603433

Locally, however, in the villages, deciduous trees and stands were maintained, and have more recently regenerated on abandoned agricultural land. We hypothesize that the present distribution of the deciduous component is related to the village in-field/out-field zonation in different regions, which emerges from physical conditions and recent economic development expressed as land-use change. We analyzed the spatial distribution of deciduous stands in in-field and out-field zones of villages in 6 boreal/hemiboreal Swedish regions (Norrbotten, Ångermanland, Jämtland, Dalarna, Bergslagen, Småland). In each region 6 individual quadrates 5 x 5 km centered on village areas were selected. We found significant regional differences in the deciduous component (DEC) in different village zones. At the scale of villages Ångermanland had the highest mean proportion of DEC (17%) and Jämtland the lowest (2%). However, the amounts of the DEC varied systematically in in-field and out-field zones. DEC was highest in the in-field in the south (Småland), but generally low further north. By contrast, the amount of DEC in the out-field was highest in the north. The relative amount of DEC in the forest edge peaked in landscapes with the strongest decline in active agriculture (Ångermanland, Dalarna, Bergslagen). Because former and present local villages are vital for biodiversity linked to the deciduous component, our results indicate a need for integrated management of deciduous forest within entire landscapes. This study shows that simplified satellite data are useful for estimating the spatial distribution of deciduous trees and stands at the landscape scale. However, for detailed studies better thematic resolution is needed to determine biologically relevant differences in quality of deciduous stands.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0346306176

We examined black-backed and three-toed woodpecker occupancy of stands in a 2-year post-fire forest, mature and old-growth spruce and pine forests, and six post-fire coniferous forests of different ages. Three-toeds were detected in old stands and in the 2-year-old burn, and their probability of occupancy of burned forests decreased between 3 and 8 years post-fire. Within 50 km of the 2-year-old burn, black-backs were only detected in the burn and not in old-growth or mature conifer stands. However, they did occupy old coniferous stands located 75 and 150 km from the recent burn. They had a similar probability of occupying stands in the 3-, 4-, and 8-year-old burns but were not detected in the 16-year-old burn. The persistence of three-toed woodpeckers in boreal Alberta will likely depend on the presence of both old-growth and recently burned coniferous forests or forests with old-growth structural characteristics.

We also examine how variation in burn characteristics (e.g., severity, age, size) and salvage logging can alter avian communities in burns. Of the 41 avian species observed in three or more studies comparing early post-fire and adjacent unburned forests, 22% are consistently more abundant in burned forests, 34% are usually more abundant in unburned forests, and 44% are equally abundant in burned and unburned forests or have varied responses. In general, woodpeckers and aerial foragers are more abundant in burned forest, whereas most foliage-gleaning species are more abundant in unburned forests. Bird species that are frequently observed in stand-replacement burns are less common in understory burns; similarly, species commonly observed in unburned forests often decrease in abundance with increasing burn severity. Granivores and species common in open-canopy forests exhibit less consistency among studies. For all species, responses to fire may be influenced by a number of factors including burn severity, fire size and shape, proximity to unburned forests, pre- and post-fire cover types, and time since fire. In addition, post-fire management can alter species' responses to burns. Most cavity-nesting species do not use severely salvaged burns, whereas some cavity-nesters persist in partially salvaged burns. Early post-fire specialists, in particular, appear to prefer unsalvaged burns. We discuss several alternatives to severe salvage-logging that will help provide habitat for cavity nesters. We provide an overview of critical research questions and design considerations crucial for evaluating the effects of prescribed fire and other anthropogenic disturbances, such as forest fragmentation. Management of native avifaunas may be most successful if natural disturbance regimes, including fire, are permitted to occur when possible. Natural fires could be augmented with practices, such as prescribed fire (including high-severity fire), that mimic inherent disturbance regimes.","Burn severity; Cavity-nesters; Fire effects; Fire suppression; Passerine birds; Prescribed fire; Salvage logging; Silviculture; Snags; Wildland fire; Woodpeckers",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036974845

Sciences, Umeå, Sweden","Current knowledge of patterns and abundance of deciduous trees in the pre-industrial landscape of boreal Sweden is limited. This is due to a dramatic transformation of the forest landscape during the last 100 years and the lack of representative forest reserves. We used historical records to study change in five mixed deciduous forests between 1866 and 1999. The results show that large changes occurred due to complex interactions between fire disturbance, fire suppression, logging and silviculture. Before fire suppression, the presence of deciduous trees was mainly determined by earlier fire influence. Later selective logging disturbed natural succession and favoured regeneration of deciduous trees. During the 20th century deciduous trees were removed by girdling, thinning and herbicide spraying. Much of the mixed deciduous stands changed to coniferous stands between 1906-15 and 1969-70, and then deciduous trees were totally removed from these stands between late 1960s and 1999. Today mixed deciduous forest occurs mainly in young stands and on other sites than previously. Our results also show that large coniferous trees and multi-aged forest occurred in all sites in the early 1900s. Most sites were dominated by coniferous species and forest dominated by deciduous trees occurred only in smaller areas. These results are not consistent with the current view that deciduous-dominated forest occupied substantial areas in boreal Sweden before fire suppression. Appropriate changes in forest management are discussed, as is the value of historical data in interpreting changes in forest landscapes.","Boreal; Deciduous trees; Fire; Forest history; Forest management; Land-use history; Logging; Regeneration; Restoration; Succession",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036914153

The difficulty surrounding the notion of landscape connectivity is that it must be assessed at the scale of the interaction between an organism and the landscape. We present a unique method for measuring connectivity between patches as a function of organism vagility. We used this approach to assess connectivity between harvest, old-growth, and recent wildfire patches in a real forested landscape in southeast British Columbia. By varying a distance criterion, habitat patches were considered connected and formed habitat clusters if they fell within this critical distance. The amount of area and distance to edge within clusters at each critical distance formed the basis of connectivity between patches. We then assessed landscape connectivity relative to old-growth associates within our study area based on species' dispersal abilities. Connectivity was greatest between harvest patches, followed by old-growth, and then wildfire patches. In old-growth patches, we found significant trends between increased connectivity and increased total habitat amount, and between decreased connectivity and increased old-growth harvesting. Highly vagile old-growth associates, such as carnivorous birds, perceive this landscape as connected and are able to access all patches. Smaller, less vagile species, such as woodpeckers, chickadees, and nuthatches, may be affected by a lack of landscape connectivity at the scale of their interaction with old-growth patches. Of particular concern is the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus), which we predict is limited in this landscape due to relatively weak dispersal abilities.

Four stand conditions were assessed: (1) unmanaged stands with high tree density, (2) thinned stands, (3) thinned and burned (with prescribed fire) stands and (4) stands that had been burned by stand replacing wildfires. The study was conducted in the ponderosa pine forests of the Coconino Plateau, northern Arizona. For several decades this area has been relatively free of bark beetle outbreaks despite the current overstocked condition of many stands. We found that a similar species assemblage composed of Dendroctonus frontalis, D. brevicomis, D. valens, D. approximatus, D. ponderosae, and Ips pini occurred across all four stand conditions over 3 years of study. The population levels of all these species were endemic across all stand conditions. The non-aggressive D. approximatus and D. valens were indicator species for thinned and unmanaged stands, respectively, but this was not consistent among years. The ambrosia beetle Gnathotrichus sp. and the bark beetle predator Enoclerus sp. consistently indicated stands burned by wildfire. In addition to our field experiment, we analyzed the historical pattern of attacks of bark beetles in our area of study. Our findings suggest that the pattern of attack of D. brevicomis (the only Dendroctonus species for which attacks have been reported) and Ips spp. has been through scattered small infestations in groups of 1-10 trees. Whereas small infestations by Ips spp. are increasing, those for D. brevicomis are decreasing. Although we agree that the high density stands in northern Arizona are in an ""unhealthy"" condition, our results do not show that they were supporting large bark beetle outbreaks. Our results challenge the theoretical assumptions about the relationship between stand structure, tree resistance and bark beetle performance. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

There was no reestablishment of the original plant cover where total heat output exceeded 100 000 kcal/m2. Apparently, most plants in this habitat were not fire resistant. Postfire recovery appears to depend on immigration of seeds from adjacent unburned areas or on seeds and rhizomes that survive on unburned microsites (refugia) within the burn. After fire, temperatures increased in the forest floor fermentative layer (FL) (10 to 19 °C) and upper 10 cm of the soil layer (SL) (3 to 7 °C) on several dates in summer 1976. Increased pH levels in FL (about 2 units) and SL (about 0.5 unit) after burning provided an improved environment for bacterial development, and counts of total bacteria and proteolytic bacteria both increased. Both nitrogen fixation and nitrification were increased after burning. Despite the apparent increase in microbiological activity, microbial respiration declined after burning-apparently because of reduced forest floor organic carbon energy reservoir. Diversity of birds increased the year after burning. New species of birds included hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus), common flicker (Colaptes auratus), and mountain bluebird (Sialia currucoides).

In this study, the effects of growing-season and dormant-season burns on plant communities were assessed in two pitcher-plant bogs on the Peason Ridge Military Reservation in western Louisiana. Measurements were collected every month from March through November 1996 and from March through October 1997. Floristic composition and forb and woody plant density were determined in both bogs. Both bogs had been burned on 3-year rotations in the dormant season for approximately 20 years. One bog, hereafter Coneflower bog, was burned during the dormant season in December 1995 and is approximately 0.8 hectare (ha). The other bog, Woodpecker bog, was burned during the growing season in August 1996 and is approximately 0.7 ha. Over both years, we found 98 plant species in both bogs together with 94 of the 98 species in Coneflower bog and 90 of the 98 species in Woodpecker bog. No species were eliminated from either bog after the fires. In addition, all species that were present after the growing season fire in Woodpecker bog had been present before the fire.

Stand age was defined as the age of the oldest tree cohort in a stand. When most fires are not stand-replacing, the theoretical equilibrium stand age distribution is either bell-shaped or bimodal and dominated by old age-classes. Old-growth forests (oldest cohort > 150 y) dominate the landscape unless fires are both frequent and severe. Simulation results and analytical calculations show that if a regime of frequent fires (about every 50 y) maintains landscapes dominated by old-growth forests, then old-growth dominance persists when the number of fires is decreased, despite the associated increase in fire severity. Simulation results were applied to Pinus sylvestris-dominated landscapes of middle boreal Fennoscandia, which according to empirical results were dominated by old-growth forests when fires were frequent during the 19th century. Since the changes in the fire regime can be plausibly explained by changes in the number of human-caused ignitions, old-growth forests have evidently also dominated the landscapes earlier when fires were less frequent. The simulation model is used to produce plausible age distributions of middle boreal Fennoscandian forest landscapes under different historical fire regimes. In summary, the frequency of large-scale disturbance alone predicts forest landscape dynamics poorly, and the roles played by fire severity and residual stands need to be considered carefully. Maintaining and restoring old-growth structures is essential to regaining the natural variability of Fennoscandian forest landscapes.","Age structure; Disturbance; Forest fire; Landscape; Modeling",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036091801

Multi-scaled investigations of habitat use are essential because different selection processes may operate at different scales. I examined the habitat use of a declining woodland passerine, the rufous treecreeper (Climacteris rufa), at three spatial scales (landscape, woodland and territory) in the wheatbelt of Western Australia. Preferential habitat use was exhibited at all scales. At the landscape scale, wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo) woodland was used at a significantly greater rate than three other common vegetation types. Territory use within woodlands was positively related to the density of hollow-bearing logs, the density of nest sites, and tree age. Within an individual territory, nest sites (hollows) were favoured if they had a spout angle of ≥ 50° to the horizontal and an entrance size of between 5 and 10 cm. The rufous treecreeper preferentially used habitat with traits characteristic of old-growth wandoo woodland. Degradation of wandoo through habitat modification (e.g. grazing, logging, fire and removal of deadwood) represents a significant threat to the persistence of treecreepers. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Historically, ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) communities were characterized by frequent, cool ground fires. Intensive fire suppression and timber harvest throughout the past century have drastically altered the structure of existing forests. Today, much of the area has been harvested using shelterwood logging resulting in open even-aged stands. The goal of this study was to compare bird communities in treated (areas that have recently been harvested) and untreated (areas receiving minimal silvicultural treatment) in the past 40 yr. Of the 20 commonly observed bird species, 3 species [red-breasted nuthatch (Sitta Canadensis), brown creeper (Certhia Americana), and ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus)] were conspicuously less abundant in treated than in untreated stands. Eleven other species were more abundant in treated stands, while six species showed no response to treatment. Although bird species diversity and the abundance of birds were highest in treated stands, this does not imply that logging is beneficial to the entire bird community. The abundance of particular bird species may appear to have increased, but the composition of the bird community has been altered. As more of the forested areas are harvested, the bird community will shift from one with birds typical of both open pine and dense pine forest to one dominated by ground foraging species.","Birds; Habitat use; Logging",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036587333

We describe an efficient method for sampling wood-boring beetle larvae, an important food of many woodpeckers, beneath the bark of fire-killed trees. The method involves taking two 225-cm2 bark samples from each tree, and provides enough information to rank most trees by relative wood-borer abundance. At two sites in the northern Rocky Mountains, we tested the reliability of this method by comparing its results to those of a more intensive sampling scheme. For 65 trees of four species, we collected eight bark samples at two different heights, 1.7 m and 6 m, and compared correlations between the smaller, ground-based sampling scheme (two bark samples) and the larger, eight-sample effort. With one exception, correlations for individual tree species ranged from 0.79 to 0.95, indicating that the smaller sample gave rankings of insect abundance comparable to those of the larger sample. Correlation strengths differed between sites, suggesting that the larger sample could be employed at future sites to fine-tune the smaller sampling scheme. Correlations for ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) at one site were very low, suggesting that wood-borers may colonize ponderosa pine in a manner different from the other tree species studied. The strong correlations produced by this test indicate that, with limited effort and training, even small field crews (e.g., two workers) can use this method to rank the foraging resources contained in dead trees.","Buprestidae; Cerambycidae; Estimating food availability; Forest fire; Picidae",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035993938

Hardwood reduction techniques had no effect on flock species richness, which averaged 7.9 and 7.2, respectively, during 1997-1998 and 1998-1999. Larger flocks in felling and girdling and in herbicide plots were primarily due to significantly higher numbers of overwintering Chipping Sparrows (Spizella passerina), as well as resident Red-cockaded Woodpeckers and an influx of temperate migrant Pine Warblers (Dendroica pinus). In contrast, flocks in control plots were smaller (flock size and species composition in spring burn plots were intermediate) and composed of hardwood-associated species, such as Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor) and Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). The relative uses of longleaf pines and hardwoods by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, Pine Warblers, and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) during both winters best explained that winter birds present in herbicide, felling and girdling, and reference plots were more likely to forage on the same tree species and substrates than birds in spring-burned plots, and least likely to forage on the same species and substrates as birds in the control plots. Those differences corresponded to the following increasing order of hardwood stem mortality among treatments: control, spring burn (41%), felling and girdling (62%), and herbicide (92%). Repeated burning is recommended to restore the reference foraging condition because it was eight times less expensive than other techniques, which favored mostly Chipping Sparrows.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036121979

We surveyed birds and sampled vegetation along 1-km line transects bisecting 14 (7 control, 7 burn) 25-ha plots located randomly within a burn and adjacent control unit. Following a spring burn that was moderate in intensity and patchy in areal extent, we observed that ground cover was affected more strongly by burning than mesquite (Prosopis) cover, smaller mesquite were affected more strongly by burning than larger mesquite, and mortality of mesquite was low. No change in total abundance of birds was detected on the burn unit following fire for either wintering or breeding birds; however, species richness of breeding birds decreased in the first year post-burn. During the breeding season, mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) increased, whereas Botteri's sparrows (Aimophila botterii), Cassin's sparrows (Aimophila cassinii), and cactus wrens (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus) decreased in relative abundance following fire. During the wintering season, ladder-backed woodpeckers (Picoides scalaris) and vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) increased and cactus wrens decreased in relative abundance following fire. Beyond species-level trends, we found stronger evidence of trends and greater magnitudes of relative change for breeding species associated with open grasslands compared to those associated with shrubs. The use of spring burns on the Refuge will likely improve conditions for open-grassland species that were historically more abundant by killing smaller mesquite and reducing mesquite recruitment. However, more intense and extensive fires will be required to reduce the presence of larger mesquite. Such fires would likely have a greater impact on birds associated with shrubs, and consequently, a greater impact on the avian community as a whole.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036288583

We investigated the effects that management for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis), thinning and burning >30 year old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) habitat, had on Wood Thrushes, a ground-foraging and midstory-nesting species. Adult Wood Thrush pairs regularly moved long distances between nesting attempts (range 1 to 17,388 m). The only experimental effect we found on adult movements was a decrease in weekly emigration rates (Ψ) from thinned and burned compartments after silvicultural management. Adult males preferred riparian hardwoods with sparse to moderate cover and those preferences increased following management. Juveniles remained near their nest site (xmacr; = 177 m, SE = 113) for an average 24 days (SE = 6.3), and then dispersed a mean 2,189 m (SE = 342). Before dispersal, juveniles preferred upland hardwood - pine mixed habitat (P < 0.05) with moderate overstory cover (P < 0.05). We found no management effects on dispersal distances or predispersal habitat use. However, juveniles from thinned and burned compartments dispersed to hardwood habitats with dense cover, whereas birds from control compartments dispersed to pine-dominated habitats with sparse cover. All juveniles dispersed to areas with habitat similar to what they used before dispersal. Small-scale thinning and burning for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers may have had little effect on Wood Thrush habitat use and movements because typical movements were often larger than the scale (stand or compartment) targeted for management.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036118774

We examined breeding bird response to habitat restoration in longleaf pine sandhill forests of northwest Florida, USA. We compared habitat variables and abundance of breeding birds among 3 hardwood reduction techniques (prescribed spring burning, herbicide application, mechanical felling-girdling) and maintenance of fire exclusion (control). We also examined abundance of breeding birds in fire-maintained, non-experimental reference sites as a means to gauge management success based on similarity analysis. All 3 hardwood reduction methods decreased midstory hardwoods and canopy cover, and increased herbaceous cover compared with fire-suppressed control plots, but had little effect on longleaf pine basal area. Midstory hardwood reduction methods increased the similarity of the breeding bird species assemblages to those found in the reference plots, compared with the fire-excluded control plots. Species that most strongly contributed to the similarity between the hardwood reduction and the reference plots were, in decreasing order of importance: red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), and brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla). Depending on the similarity index used, additional but weaker contributors to the similarity between the hardwood reduction and the reference plots were northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis), and Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). Species associated with hardwoods (e.g., tufted titmouse, northern cardinal, Carolina chickadee) contributed to greater similarity of the reference condition by decreasing in abundance after hardwood reduction, whereas open-habitat species increased in numbers, compared with birds on the fire-excluded control plots. Only the detection rates of cardinals and Carolina chickadees were not different among hardwood reduction methods. Two notable species of concern that increased in all hardwood reduction plots compared with the control, but were not strong contributors of the similarity to the reference condition, were northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and southeastern American kestrel (Falco sparverius paulus). Our results suggest that these management methods were beneficial to landbirds characteristic of fire-maintained longleaf pine sandhills in northwest Florida. However, northern bobwhites and Bachman's sparrows may require more intensive management than red-cockaded woodpeckers, such as shorter burn intervals, as these species depend directly on ground cover vegetation. We recommend prescribed spring burning as the most economical and ecologically desirable method for managing breeding bird habitat in longleaf pine sandhill forests.","Aimophila aestivalis; Bachman's sparrow; Chainsaw felling and girdling; Colinus virginianus; Fire; Florida; Hardwood reduction; Herbicide; Longleaf pine; Northern bobwhite; Picoides borealis; Pinus palustris; Red-cockaded woodpecker",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036638288

Hermit thrushes were positively correlated with snag density while yellow warblers and Swainson's thrushes were positively associated with deciduous tree cover and negatively correlated with conifer cover. Only yellow-rumped warblers had higher densities on clear-cut sites, likely due to greater conifer cover. Bird densities and species richness peaked in the 14-year-old burns and exceeded that of mature forests reported for Labrador. This demonstrates the importance of natural early successional forests for birds. Although logged areas support several species found in natural young burns, logging does not precisely mimic fire.

These stands had the smallest disc of vulnerability and the greatest understory shrub cover <2 m in height compared with other treatments. A threshold-like increase in bobwhite abundance was observed as a function of woody structure <2 m. Pine-grassland restoration provided suitable structure for bobwhites in spring, summer, and fall, but may not be adequate in winter. Further, data suggested that bobwhite density within a stand also was related to the amount of suitable habitat surrounding the stand.

No differences in species richness or diversity (Simpson, Shannon-Wiener and Berger-Parker indices) were found for spiders or carabid beetles. Overall, the relationship between abundance and time since burning was weak, with marginal significance found only for Dictynidae and Gnaphosidae. We suggest that changes in foraging substrate, prey availability or microclimatic conditions since fire may have interacted with life history characteristics to influence the abundance of these organisms.

Annual counts of acorns on two white oaks (Quercus chapmanii and Q. geminata) and two red oaks (Q. laevis and Q. myrtifolia) were conducted annually (except in 1991) on two 2.7-ha grids from 1969 to 1998. A prescribed burn was conducted on one of the grids in May 1993. Newly sprouted ramets of both white oaks produced acorns during the first year following the fire, whereas red oaks required 3 yr (Q. myrtifolia) or 4 yr (Q. laevis) to produce acorns. The difference in the timing of post-fire acorn production between the white and red oak species reflected the difference in the number of years from flower bud initiation to mature acorns in the two groups, with the additional year-long lag in Q. laevis probably attributable to the fact that it is typically a tree rather than a shrub species. The data suggested that percentage of bearing ramets in the smallest size class of the two white oak species was markedly lower in the burned than unburned grid in the first year of post-fire acorn production and higher in the fifth year, but these trends were not evident for the red oaks. Among all four species, differences between mean number of acorns in burned and unburned grids were significant in only two cases (the largest size class of both white oak species in the fifth year). There was no evidence of recruitment from acorns on the burned grid, possibly due to the rapid redevelopment of the shrub layer because of low mortality of the extensive clonal root systems. Rapid post-fire recovery of acorn production in xeric fire-prone habitats is presumably the result of selection to increase the probability of recovery and persistence following sufficiently intense fires that result in high oak mortality. The timing and magnitude of post-fire acorn production in sandhill and other xeric Florida associations has a potential impact on a wide variety of insects, birds, and mammals that feed on acorns, as well as on the species with which they interact.","Acorn; Fire ecology; Florida; Fruiting patterns; Quercus; Southern ridge sandhill",Article,Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036190968

These forests are managed throughout the region; species composition is influenced by topography, soil composition, periodic natural and prescribed fires, and forest harvesting practices. Our objective was to describe the canopy and ground layer vegetation of upland sites at Fort Benning, Georgia that are managed primarily for longleaf pine (thinned, burned at 3 year intervals) and differ in soil texture (from sandy to clayey) and intensity of military training (lighter dismounted infantry vs. heavier mechanized training). We characterized surface soil texture and land-use disturbance of 32 sites, each 400 m × 400 m, and asked if canopy and ground layer community measures (species composition and richness, basal area, abundance) differed among sites on the basis of soil texture or land-use. There was significant interaction between land-use and soil texture, with a gradient of soil texture (% clay) from clayey sites within light training areas, to sandy sites in heavier training areas. Road-like features, including active and remnant trails, roads, and vehicle tracks or trails were the most frequent and abundant disturbance feature. Number of disturbance features per site did not differ among land-use/surface soil texture categories. Differences in ground layer and canopy composition among sites reflected disturbance intensity; differences in canopy composition also reflected the proportion of pine. Species richness of ground layer vegetation differed among surface soil texture/land-use categories. There was a richness gradient from heavily disturbed sites with clayey soil, through lightly disturbed sites, to heavily disturbed sites with sandy soil. Our results suggest upland pine-oak-hickory forests at Fort Benning range from sandhills scrub oak-pine to pine-hardwood to oak-hickory dominated forests, with greater species diversity in the ground layer of clayey sites. Forestry practices and disturbances associated with mechanized military training favor pine dominance, and maintain open-site, successional or fire-tolerant species in the ground layer. Although intense management toward pine monocultures can reduce within-stand diversity, federal installations such as Fort Benning may help conserve pine-oak-hickory forests in the rapidly developing Sandhills region.","Disturbance; Fort Benning; Pine-oak-hickory forests; Sandhills; Soil texture",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036824547

Recent incentives have led to increased interest in longleaf pine restoration. These restoration efforts often emphasize reestablishing native groundcovers, yet there have been no studies that address the role of native groundcover on breeding bird communities within longleaf pine forests. Therefore, we studied breeding bird communities in mature longleaf pine stands with either native or disturbed groundcovers to determine the likely effects of groundcover reestablishment associated with longleaf pine reforestation. Avian species richness and diversity did not differ (P=0.823, P=0.571, respectively), and avian community similarity was high (Morisita's index=0.98) between native and disturbed groundcover. However, pine warblers (Dendroica pinus), gray catbirds (Dumetella carolinensis), eastern wood-pewees (Contopus virens), brown-headed cowbirds (Molothrus ater), and Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) were more abundant (P≤0.10) in areas with native groundcover, whereas indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea) were more abundant (P=0.058) in areas with disturbed groundcover. Although groundcover restoration may benefit some avian populations, overall avian species richness, diversity, and community composition may be unaffected. Restoration of native groundcover may be best justified for aesthetic values and as a tool to facilitate long-term stand management using prescribed fire.","Avian community; Conservation Reserve Program; CRP; Ecosystem management; Georgia; Longleaf pine; Native groundcover; Pinus palustris; Restoration; Species diversity",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036071311

However, determination of manageable reference conditions has lagged behind the interest. This paper presents a case study from pine-dominated forests in the Upper West Gulf Coastal Plain (UWGCP), with special emphasis on southern Arkansas. Decades of forest management, fire exclusion, exotic species invasion, and other ecological changes have converted the small remnants of mature shortleaf (Pinus echinata Mill.) and loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) stands into ineffectual models for restoring presettlement-like conditions. However, sufficient information can be gathered from available references to more reliably describe the boundaries of the desired reference environment. Early explorer accounts, maps, survey records, historical trade and technical publications, and modern scientific journals were consulted to reconstruct presettlement (pre-1900) forest conditions for pine-dominated landscapes of the UWGCP. On average, virgin UWGCP pine forests had considerably more shortleaf pine (especially in the uplands) than contemporary natural stands, with relatively low basal area and standing volume concentrated in large trees. Presettlement pine timber also had less uniform structural and spatial patterns than modern examples of mature pine. Assuming most of the critical processes are still present, it appears possible to recreate the compositional and structural attributes of virgin pine forests.","Loblolly pine; Pinus; Presettlement vegetation; Shortleaf pine; Virgin forest",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0036824544

In North America, these habitats or ecosystems include grasslands or prairies, shrublands, savannas, early successional forests, and floodplains. Whereas the extent of all natural habitats has diminished significantly owing to outright loss from agriculture and development, the suppression of disturbance by agents such as fire and flooding has led to further losses. Accordingly, the abundances of many bird species adapted to disturbance-mediated habitats have declined as well. In North America, these declines have been more severe and common than those of species associated with less frequently disturbed habitats such as mature or closed-canopy forests. Field studies consistently reveal the direct role of disturbance and successional processes in structuring avian habitats and communities. Conservation strategies involving the management of disturbance through some combination of flooding, application of fire, or the expression of wildfire, and use of certain types of silviculture have the potential to diversify avian habitats at the local, landscape, and regional scale. Many aspects of the disturbance ecology of birds require further research. Important questions involve associations between the intensity and frequency of disturbance and the viability of bird populations, the scale of disturbance with respect to the spatial structure of populations, and the role of natural vs. anthropogenic disturbance. The effects of disturbance and ensuing successional processes on birds are potentially long-term, and comprehensive monitoring is essential.","Fire; Flood pulse; Habitat selection; Silviculture; Successional habitats",Review,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035670207

Those bird species of concern that occur in forested habitats in eastern Oregon and Washington include the bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), harlequin duck (Histrionicus histrionicus), upland sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda), northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), ferruginous hawk (Buteo regalis), and black rosy finch (Leucosticte arctoa). In addition, seven species of woodpeckers and nuthatches were considered because of their rare status. Forest disturbances that create dead trees and logs are critical to cavity-nesting birds because the dead trees with their subsequent decay provide nesting and roosting habitat. The insects associated with outbreaks or dead trees provide prey for the woodpeckers and nuthatches. The loss of nest or roost trees as a result of disturbance could be detrimental to bald eagles, goshawks, or ferruginous hawks, while the loss of canopy cover could be detrimental to harlequin ducks and goshawks or to prey of some of the raptors. The more open canopies created by thinning may be beneficial to a species like the black rosy finch, yet detrimental to some woodpeckers due to a decrease in cover. Prescribed burning may be beneficial to those woodpeckers primarily associated with ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands and detrimental to other woodpeckers because of the loss of coarse woody debris. Removal of roads is likely to benefit most of these species because of the subsequent decrease in human activity.

Stands with the medium snag density treatment had the highest abundance, species richness, and nesting population of cavity nesters. The reasons for this may be: 1) snags were not evenly distributed within a stand such that both clumped and dispersed snag density habitats were interspersed in this treatment, and 2) a greater proportion of ponderosa pine snags in medium density treatments may have attracted species that prefer ponderosa pine for nesting and foraging. Ponderosa pine was preferred for nest sites and large snags (> 48 cm dbh) provided nesting habitat for more species than smaller snags.

To examine the characteristics of understory species that distinguish between disturbances induced by military traffic, we randomly established transects in four training intensity categories (reference, light, moderate, and heavy) and in an area that had been remediated following intense disturbance at Fort Benning, GA. A total of 134 plant species occurred in these transects with the highest diversity (95 species) in light training areas and the lowest (16 species) in heavily disturbed plots. Forty-seven species were observed in only one of the five disturbance categories. The variability in understory vegetation cover among disturbance types was trimodal ranging from less than 5% cover for heavily disturbed areas to 67% cover for reference, light, and remediated areas. High variability in species diversity and lack of difference in understory cover led us to consider life-form and plant families as indicators of military disturbance. Life-form successfully distinguished between plots based on military disturbances. Species that are Phanerophytes (trees and shrubs) were the most frequent life-form encountered in sites that experienced light infantry training. Therophytes (annuals) were the least common life-form in reference and light training areas. Chamaephytes (plants with their buds slightly above ground) were the least frequent life-form in moderate and remediation sites. Heavy training sites supported no Chamaephytes or Hemicryptophytes (plants with dormant buds at ground level). The heavy, moderate, remediated, and reference sites were all dominated by Cryptophytes (plants with underground buds) possibly because of their ability to withstand both military disturbance and ground fires (the natural disturbance of longleaf pine forests). Analysis of soils collected from each transect revealed that depth of the A layer of soil was significantly higher in reference and light training areas which may explain the life-form distributions. In addition, the diversity of plant families and, in particular, the presence of grasses and composites were indicative of training and remediation history. These results are supported by prior analysis of life-form distribution subsequent to other disturbances and demonstrate the ability of life-form and plant families to distinguish between military disturbances in longleaf pine forests. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A high proportion of these species is forest living, and large numbers are dependent on decaying wood. Biodiversity can be assessed at various scales using two different principles. One is to use features, such as ancient and dead trees, known to be important for a large number of species. The other method is to choose species or groups of species known to indicate high biodiversity or presence of many red-listed species. We argue that any serious biodiversity assessment method should include the most species rich organism groups, for example insects. In the present paper we point out the most important features for high biodiversity (old trees and large dead trees), and review the quantities of these features in near-virgin forests. The natural disturbance regime of a region should be the basis for defining a suitable scale and the appropriate features for biodiversity assessment. Possible indicator species for high biodiversity in northern Europe are suggested, based on previous investigations. Among epiphytic lichens and wood-living beetles there are many potentially useful species in addition to vascular plants in the nemoral forest. Among vertebrates, woodpeckers and grouses seem to be the most useful. Validation tests for indicator structures and species are largely lacking but urgently needed. The implications of possible delayed local extinctions are important to bear in mind when managing for sustainable forestry.

We studied the effects of repeated burning (1-4 years of annual burning) and recovery (1 year after burning) on the breeding bird community. Burning resulted in incremental but temporary reductions in the availability of leaf litter, shrubs, and saplings, but it did not affect trees, snags, or understory vegetation cover. Of 30 bird species monitored, 4 were affected negatively and 2 were affected positively by burning. Population densities of Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warblers (Helmitheros vermivorus), and Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia citrina) declined incrementally in response to repeated burning and did not recover within I year after burning, suggesting a lag time in response to the changes in habitat conditions. Densities of Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) fluctuated among years in the control units, but remained low in the burned units. Densities of American Robins (Turdus migratorius) and Eastern Wood-Pewees (Contopus virens) increased in response to burning, but these increases were apparent only after several years of repeated burning. In general, burning resulted in short-term reductions in the suitability of habitat for ground- and low-shrub-nesting birds, but it improved habitat for ground- and aerial-foraging birds. Overall, there were no changes in the composition of the breeding-bird community. Total breeding bird population levels were also unaffected by burning. Our results suggest that prescribed burning applied on a long-term basis or across large spatial scales is likely to have adverse effects on ground- and low-shrub-nesting bird species, but other changes in the composition of the breeding-bird community are likely to be minimal as long as the closed-canopy forest structure is maintained within the context of prescribed burning.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034798709

As in unburned stands, log retrieval systems vary considerably in their immediate effect on soils in the postfire environment, with ground-based systems generally causing more disturbance than aerial systems. Timber harvest methods used by managers can mitigate erosion effects-for example, logging residue can decrease erosion by impeding overland flow. Ground disturbance from postfire logging can encourage establishment of different plant species (including nonnatives) and can influence the growth of trees. The removal of large woody structures typical in postfire logging operations can change plant species composition, reduce plant species richness, and increase conifer growth in the first years after logging, but can also reduce the probability that insect pest populations will build up and infest adjacent stands. Removal of large woody structures can cause declines in the abundance of several cavity-nesting bird species, including mountain bluebird, and black-backed, hairy, and three-toed woodpeckers; Lewis' woodpecker tends to increase after postfire logging. Overall, studies on the environmental effects of postfire logging are limited, arguing for the use of adaptive management to monitor effects of logging and to adjust practices accordingly. West. J.

Although the rate of fire has on the whole increased in recent years, the affected area is on an average much lower.

No prior study, however, has demonstrated the relative importance of crown-burned forests to this woodpecker species by examining its reproductive success in different forest types. We studied breeding Lewis's Woodpeckers in cottonwood (Populus fremontii) riparian forest patches of Colorado and crown-burned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of Idaho to compare their reproductive success, productivity, and potential source-sink status in the two forest types. Daily nest survival rates were significantly lower in cottonwood compared to burned pine forests. Nesting success was 46% (n = 65) in cottonwood forests and 78% (n = 283) in burned pine forests. Proportion of nests destroyed by predators was significantly higher in cottonwood forests (34%) compared to burned pine forests (16%). We consistently found crown-burned forests to be potential source habitat, whereas cottonwood riparian sites were more often concluded to be potential sink habitat. Cottonwood riparian forests were surrounded primarily by an agricultural landscape where the composition and abundance of nest predators was likely very different than the predator assemblage occupying a large-scale burn in a relatively natural landscape. Conversion of riparian and adjacent grassland landscapes to agriculture and prevention of wildfire in ponderosa pine forests have likely reduced nesting habitat for this species. Prescribed understory fire is the prevailing management tool for restoring ponderosa pine ecosystems. Conditions created by crown fire may be equally important in maintaining ponderosa pine systems and conserving nesting habitat for the Lewis's Woodpecker.","Crown-burned forests; Lewis's woodpecker; Melanerpes lewis; Nest success; Pinus ponderosa; Populus fremontii; Source-sink habitats",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034863367

Management practices vary greatly among land ownerships. In some wilderness areas and state parks, a ""no management"" policy has eliminated use of prescribed fire, artificial cavities, and woodpecker translocation, tools that have proved effective elsewhere in recovering woodpecker populations. We compared forests with essentially ""no management"" to actively managed forests of similar tree ages and similar red-cockaded woodpecker population demographics. We also compared sites that had received no management in the past to the same sites after management. In every case, populations in forests that did not use state-of-the-art management for woodpeckers declined severely compared to those in managed forests. Because managed forests typically used all available management techniques concurrently, it was not possible to separate and rank effectiveness of specific management activities. One exception was the Wade Tract in Georgia, where prescribed fire was the primary activity for herbaceous layer and hardwood management in a high-density, stable woodpecker population. Wilderness areas, which are intended to be pristine places that preserve biodiversity, are losing red-cockaded woodpeckers, a keystone species in the ecosystem, at an alarming rate. Collectively, 9 groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers were present in 4 wilderness areas in Texas national forests in 1983. At the close of the millennium, only one woodpecker group remained and its continued existence is unlikely without management. The very fragmented features of present-day landscapes and intervention by humans impair the effectiveness of natural disturbance processes, primarily growing-season fire, that historically produced and maintained open pine savannas with grass-forb herbaceous layers in the pre-Columbian forests of the southeastern U.S.; therefore, active management must be used if the red-cockaded woodpecker is to persist.","Fire-maintained ecosystems; Picoides borealis; Red-cockaded woodpecker; Wilderness",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034766972

Analyses of the covariation between demographic and habitat features can reveal a trajectory toward this optimal state. To help identify new criteria for foraging-habitat guidelines for the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) in the Apalachicola National Forest, we examine seven years of demographic data for the woodpecker population and habitat in core stands, the naturally regenerated prime habitat in the centers of their territories. For both districts of the forest, two compound habitat variables are highly related to the average number of adult birds per social group, the average number of young fledged per group, and the density of groups. These variables are, first, the difference between the density of trees >35 cm dbh and that of trees 15-25 cm dbh and, second, the difference, in the ground cover, between the percentage of wiregrass and that of woody-plus-palmetto vegetation. Although the birds require a few old relict trees for their cavities, a regression analysis shows that including data for variation in the availability of relict trees in this forest does not improve the power of the above habitat variables to account for variation in the demography of the birds. Because covariation between demographic variables and the recommendations in the current federal guidelines for the management of foraging habitat of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker is low, we conclude that experimental tests of whether causal mechanisms underlie the much higher correlative relationships we have found are warranted. Such tests should use differing levels of prescribed fire, which has dramatic effects on the ground cover. Smaller size classes of trees in closed-canopy stands should be thinned, creating patchy openings in the forest that will promote natural pine regeneration. Traditional uneven-aged silvicultural management could adopt a target tree distribution similar to that on the Apalachicola Ranger District, which supports a population of woodpeckers that is deemed to have recovered. We think that in addition to being beneficial for the birds the proposed program of habitat management is more likely to promote the long-term restoration of the longleaf pine/wiregrass ecosystem within Red-cockaded Woodpecker habitat than are alternative scenarios.","Apalachicola National Forest (Florida, USA); Ecosystem management; Endangered species; Florida, northern; Foraging guidelines; Habitat; Longleaf pine; Niche gestalt; Picoides borealis; Pinus palustris; Red-cockaded Woodpecker",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034989493

Historically, the members of the bark beetle guild acted as disturbance agents, working in concert with fire to maintain a vegetation mosaic heavily dominated by longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) or shortleaf pine (P. echinata) woodlands and forests. These forest types were. relatively resistant to large infestations of southern pine beetle (SPB). This study proposes that mortality caused by the other guild members was more prevalent for long periods of time, and that human alteration of forests in terms of species composition and structure has created conditions conducive for SPB outbreaks.

Herbivores and pathogens are an integral part of forests, but sometimes produce undesirable effects and a degradation of forest resources. In the United States, a few species of forest pests routinely have significant impacts on up to 20 million ha of forest with economic costs that probably exceed $1 billion/year. Climatic change could alter patterns of disturbance from herbivores and pathogens through: (1) direct effects on the development and survival of herbivores and pathogens; (2) physiological changes in tree defenses; and (3) indirect effects from changes in the abundance of natural enemies (e.g. parasitoids of insect herbivores), mutualists (e.g. insect vectors of tree pathogens), and competitors. Because of their short life cycles, mobility, reproductive potential, and physiological sensitivity to temperature, even modest climate change will have rapid impacts on the distribution and abundance of many forest insects and pathogens. We identify 32 syndromes of biotic disturbance in North American forests that should be carefully evaluated for their responses to climate change: 15 insect herbivores, browsing mammals; 12 pathogens; 1 plant parasite; and 3 undiagnosed patterns of forest decline. It is probable that climatic effects on some herbivores and pathogens will impact on biodiversity, recreation, property value, forest industry, and even water quality. Some scenarios are beneficial (e.g. decreased snow cover may increase winter mortality of some insect pests), but many are detrimental (e.g. warming tends to accelerate insect development rate and facilitate range expansions of pests and climate change tends to produce a mismatch between mature trees and their environment, which can increase vulnerability to herbivores and pathogens). Changes in forest disturbance can produce feedback to climate through affects on water and carbon flux in forest ecosystems; one alarming scenario is that climate warming may increase insect outbreaks in boreal forests, which would tend to increase forest fires and exacerbate further climate warming by releasing carbon stores from boreal ecosystems. We suggest a list of research priorities that will allow us to refine these risk assessments and adopt forest management strategies that anticipate changes in biotic disturbance regimes and mitigate the ecological, social, and economic risks.

We also summarized knowledge about species-road relations for each species and mapped source habitats in relation to road densities for four species of terrestrial carnivores. Our assessment was conducted as part of the Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project (ICBEMP), a multiresource, multidisciplinary effort by the USDA Forest Service (FS) and the USDI Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to develop an ecosystem-based strategy for managing FS and BLM lands within the basin. Our results indicated that habitats for species, groups, and families associated with old-forest structural stages, with native grasslands, or with native shrublands have undergone strong, widespread decline. Implications of these results for managing old-forest structural stages include consideration of (1) conservation of habitats in sub-basins and watersheds where decline in old forests has been strongest; (2) silvicultural manipulations of mid-seral forests to accelerate development of late-seral stages; and (3) long-term silvicultural manipulations and long-term accommodation of fire and other disturbance regimes in all forested structural stages to hasten development and improvement in the amount, quality, and distribution of old-forest stages. Implications of our results for managing rangelands include the potential to (1) conserve native grasslands and shrublands that have not undergone large-scale reduction in composition of native plants; (2) control or eradicate exotic plants on native grasslands and shrublands where invasion potential or spread of exotics is highest; and (3) restore native plant communities by using intensive range practices where potential for restoration is highest. Our analysis also indicated that >70 percent of the 91 species are affected negatively by one or more factors associated with roads. Moreover, maps of the abundance of source habitats in relation to classes of road density suggested that road-associated factors hypothetically may reduce the potential to support persistent populations of terrestrial carnivores in many subbasins. Management implications of our summarized road effects include the potential to mitigate a diverse set of negative factors associated with roads. Comprehensive mitigation of road-associated factors would require a substantial reduction in the density of existing roads as well as effective control of road access in relation to management of livestock, timber, recreation, hunting, trapping, mineral development, and other human activities. A major assumption of our work was that validation research will be conducted by agency scientists and other researchers to corroborate our findings. As a preliminary step in the process of validation, we found high agreement between trends in source habitats and prior trends in habitat outcomes that were estimated as part of the habitat outcome analysis for terrestrial species within the basin. Results of our assessment also were assumed to lead to finer scale evaluations of habitats for some species, groups, or families as part of implementation procedures. Implementation procedures are necessary to relate our findings to local conditions; this would enable managers to effectively apply local conservation and restoration practices to support broad-scale conservation and restoration strategies that may evolve from our findings.","Cluster analysis; Conservation; Forest management; Habitat; Habitat condition; Habitat management; Habitat trend; Interior Columbia basin; Interior Columbia Basin Ecosystem Management Project; Landscape analysis; Landscape ecology; Monitoring; Population viability; Rangeland management; Restoration; Sink; Sink environment; Source; Source environment; Source habitat; Source habitats; Spatial analysis; Species groups; Species of focus; Terrestrial vertebrates; Validation research; Viability; Wildlife; Wildlife-habitat relations",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-6744263833

To determine the effects this harvesting strategy might have on communities of breeding forest birds, we conducted point counts in young forests regenerated from clear-cutting (15-25 years), and mature (50-60 years), and old (80-110 years) forests regenerated from fire. Avian species richness was highest in old stands at the point-count station, forest stand, and landscape level. Increased species richness with forest age was associated with increases in the relative abundance of canopy- and cavity-nesting species. At local scales (station and stand), species richness of ground- and shrub-nesting birds was similar among forest age-classes. However, as determined by rarefaction analyses appropriate at the landscape scale, ground-nesting species were more common in young and old forests, while shrub-nesting species were more common in young and mature forests. Density of deciduous shrubs was an important factor influencing the abundance of species like American redstart, Canada warbler, and chestnut-sided warbler. An increase in conifer in old stands resulted in greater use by conifer- or mixedwood associated species such as bay-breasted warbler, magnolia warbler, and ruby-crowned kinglet. Our data indicate that vegetation and structural characteristics such as shrub density should be considered when prescribing sustainable forestry objectives.

We characterized remnant forest patches and compared them to matrix forest in young, mature and old age classes. Remnant patches could be discriminated from matrix forest types based on variables relating to tree overstory and snag density. Some remnants displayed a unique uneven-aged pattern of lodgepole pine regeneration. Differences between remnant patches and matrix forest stands, and high variation among patches, may reflect the variable influence of the wildfires through which the patches survived. Remnants share many ecological characteristics with old forest and may provide 'bridging habitats' in landscapes recovering from large-scale disturbance. Patches of mature forest retained in logged landscapes may have potential to substitute for wildfire remnants. However, selection and management criteria should be developed to guide the design of habitat retention and to monitor effects.

However, there have been few studies of the effects of fire on the avifauna during the restoration process. To study the effects of oak savanna restoration on avian communities, breeding birds were censused and the vegetation structure documented in seven experimental burn units (8-18 ha) that had experienced different frequencies of controlled burns during the past 31 years (0-26 burns). Data were analyzed with both direct and indirect gradient analyses using multivariate techniques. The results showed that, as savanna restoration proceeded, there was a general decline in predominantly insectivorous species, particularly those that feed in the upper canopy region (leaves and air space), and a general increase in omnivorous species, particularly those that feed on the ground and in the lower canopy. Insectivorous bark gleaners (woodpeckers) also increased during restoration and were correlated with the increase in standing dead trees resulting from the fires. Overall, savanna restoration resulted in increases in the abundance of many open country bird species, including many species that have been declining in central and eastern North America, including red-headed woodpecker, Baltimore oriole, eastern kingbird, vesper sparrow, field sparrow, lark sparrow, brown thrasher, American goldfinch, and brown-headed cowbird. The shifts in species and guilds were correlated with changes in burn frequency and the macro vegetation structure-tree and shrub density, leaf area index, and relative proportion of standing dead trees. The findings show that savanna restoration can increase bird diversity and provide important habitat for uncommon or declining bird species. These birds are most likely attracted to one or more of the distinctive habitat features of the restored savanna environments, including scattered mature trees, standing dead trees and snags, and presence of both shrubby and grassland vegetation. The findings also suggest that restoration ecologists and wildlife biologists will need to work together to achieve desired goals, since different types of savanna restoration efforts may produce different effects on the breeding bird community.","Bird communities; Bird foraging guilds; Fire; Oaks; Restoration ecology; Savanna",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034063485

Stn., 1401 G., La Grande, OR 97850, United States","Advanced forest succession and associated accumulations of forest biomass in the Blue Mountains of Oregon and Washington and Intermountain area have led to increased vulnerability of these forests to insects, diseases, and wildfire. One proposed solution is large-scale conversion of these forests to seral conditions that emulate those assumed to exist before European settlement: open-spaced stands (ca. 50 trees per ha), consisting primarily of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) and western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.). We question how well presettlement forest conditions are understood and the feasibility and desirability of conversion to a seral state that represents those conditions. Current and future expectations of forest outputs and values are far different from those at presettlement times. Emphasis on prescribed fire for achieving and maintaining this conversion raises questions about how well we understand fire effects on forest resources and values. We consider here potential effects of prescribed fire on two key aspects of forest management - productivity and wildlife. Use of large-scale prescribed fire presents complex problems with potential long-term effects on forest resources. Before implementing prescribed fire widely, we need to understand the range of its effects on all resources and values. Rather than attempting to convert forests to poorly described and understood presettlement seral conditions, it would seem prudent to examine present forest conditions and assess their potential to provide desired resource outputs and values. Once this is achieved, the full complement of forest management tools and strategies, including prescribed fire, should be used to accomplish the desired objectives. We suggest a more conservative approach until prescribed fire effects are better understood.

Twenty-two of 59 Great Crested Fycatcher nests were depredated and the proportions in each burn class were similar.

This species has a strong association with old-growth forests that also have economic value as timber. Research questions relevant to conservation of this species include how temporal trends in Northern Spotted Owl populations are influenced and how spatial configuration of old-growth forests affects these populations. To address these questions, we studied a population of marked Northern Spotted Owls on 95 territories in northwestern California from 1985 through 1994. We examined the magnitude of temporal and spatial variation in life history traits (survival, reproductive output, and recruitment), the effects of climate and landscape characteristics on temporal and spatial variation in these traits, respectively, and how this variation affected aspects of population dynamics. We used a components-of-variation analysis to partition sampling from process variation, and a model selection approach to estimate life history traits using capturerecapture and random-effects models. Climate explained most of the temporal variation in life history traits. Annual survival varied the least over time, whereas recruitment rate varied the most, suggesting a 'bet-hedging' life history strategy for the owl. A forecast of annual rates of population change (λ), estimated from life history traits, suggested that Northern Spotted Owl populations may change solely due to climate influences, even with unchanging habitat conditions. In terms of spatial variation, annual survival on territories was positively associated both with amounts of interior old-growth forest and with length of edge between those forests and other vegetation types. Reproductive output was negatively associated with interior forest, but positively associated with edge between mature and old-growth conifer forest and other vegetation types. A gradient existed in territory-specific estimates of fitness derived from these life history estimates. This gradient suggested that a mosaic of older forest interspersed with other vegetation types promoted high fitness in Northern Spotted Owls. Habitat quality, as defined by fitness, appeared to buffer variation in annual survival but did not buffer reproductive output. We postulated that the magnitude of λ was determined by habitat quality, whereas variation of λ was influenced by recruitment and reproductive output. As habitat quality declines, variation in λ should become more pronounced.","California; Climate effects; Components of variation; Environmental stochasticity; Fitness; Fragmentation; Habitat effects; Habitat mosaics; Model selection; Northern Spotted Owl; Population rates of change; Strix occidentalis caurina",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033749624

We conducted a 4-year study to determine the effects of winter prescribed burning and forest thinning on breeding wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) populations at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge (PNWR) in Georgia. We estimated density, adult and juvenile survival rates, and apparent annual survival using transect surveys, radiotelemetry, and mist netting. Burning and thinning did not cause lower densities (P = 0.25); wood thrush density, ranged from 0.15 to 1.30 pairs/10 ha. No radiomarked male wood thrushes (n = 68) died during the 4 years, but female weekly survival was 0.981 ± 0.014 (SE) for females (n = 63) and 0.976 = 0.010 for juveniles (n = 38). Apparent annual adult survival was 0.579 (SE = 0.173). Thinning and prescribed burning did not reduce adult or juvenile survival during the breeding season or apparent annual adult survival. Annual population growth (γ) at PNWR was 1.00 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.32-1.63), and the considerable uncertainty in this prediction underscores the need for long-term monitoring to effectively manage Neotropical migrants. Population growth increased on experimental compartments after the burn and thin (95% CI before = 0.91-0.97, after = 0.98-1.05), while control compartment γ declined (before = 0.98-1.05, after = 0.87-0.92). We found no evidence that the current management regime at PNWR, designed to improve red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) habitat, negatively affected wood thrushes.","Density; Forest management; Hylocichla mustelina; Neotropical migrant songbird; Radiotelemetry; Survival; Transect surveys; Wood thrush",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033977657

Sixty forest-dependent bird species were recorded, amongst them three that are globally threatened (Sokoke Pipit Anthus sokolcensis, Spotted Ground Thrush Turdus fischeri, East Coast Akalat Sheppardia gunningi) three that are near-threatened (Southern Banded Snake Eagle Circaetus fasciolatus, Fischer’s Turaco Tauraco fischeri, Plain-backed Sunbird Anthrepres reichenowi) and four that are ‘restricted-range’ (Fischer’s Turaco, Sokoke Pipit, Mombasa Woodpecker Campethera mombassica, Uluguru Violet-backed Sunbird Anthreptes neglectus). Globally or regionally threatened and near-threatened species were relatively rare and were patchily distributed across forests. In contrast, most other forest species were widely distributed, being present in most or all fragments. The breakdown of traditional conservation systems, selective logging, encroachment by cultivation and fire-maintained grassland, fragmentation, allocation of land for urban development, pole cutting, charcoal burning, hunting and trapping, prospective mining, bark stripping and elephant damage are the major threats to the continued survival of these forests.

Bird surveys between 1992 and 1996, the first since 1949, covered 20 main areas, with incidental records from many others. This paper reviews the status of all Lao species reported to be of elevated conservation concern (key species) in any of the following categories: Globally Threatened or Globally Near-Threatened (sensu Collar and Andrew 1988 and Collar et al. 1994), and At Risk or Rare in Thailand (sensn Round 1988 and Treesucon and Round 1990). Several additional species are covered which have clearly undergone a National Historical Decline in Laos. A comprehensive review of other Lao species was not possible, and some species which are in truth of conservation concern have doubtless been overlooked. Historical and modern records were reviewed and population trends identified where possible. Current global status listings (Collar et ni. 1994) were supported, except that consideration should be given to changing Red-collared Woodpecker Picus rabieri and Sooty Babbler Stnchyris herberti from Threatened to Near-Threatened. If the Lao situation is representative of the species throughout their range, then consideration should also be given to placing Ratchet-tailed Treepie Temnttrus temmmis and River Lapwing Vanellus duvaiicelii as Near-Threatened. Twenty-seven Globally Threatened species are known from Laos, of which there are recent records of 22. There are recent unconfirmed records of two more. Forty-seven Globally Near-Threatened species are known from Laos, of which there are recent records of 39; there are unconfirmed records of one further species. Five Globally Threatened and five Near-Threatened species were recorded for the first time in Laos in recent years, suggesting that further species of elevated conservation concern remain to be found. All species reviewed were placed in one of the four categories: At Risk in Laos, Potentially At Risk in Laos, Little Known and Not At Risk in Laos. These are assessed in the light of foreseeable threats; some species may move into a higher category of threat in due course. Forty-four species are thought to be At Risk in Laos; there are no recent records of four of these. Twenty-five species are thought to be Potentially At Risk in Laos; there are no recent records of two of these. Thirty-four species considered by this review are thought to be Not At Risk in Laos at the current time, whilst there is insufficient information to make an assessment (termed Little Known) for another 32 species. Laos retains a much higher proportion of forest cover than do most neighbours, including substantial lengths of almost pristine riverine forest in the Nam Theun and Xe Kong basins, extensive level lowland forest (especially at Xe Pian National Biodiversity Conservation Area and Dong Khanthung Proposed Protected Area in the South) and considerable amounts of slope forest at all altitudes. At least 27 forest species seem to occur in globally significant numbers. This is probably because the surveyed forests were large in relation to hunting and degradation pressures on the populations of most species. Logging of virgin areas, hydropower schemes and clearance of forest for cultivation will soon reverse this situation unless controls are established. At least 35 of the species under consideration have declined over the past 50 years by a magnitude exceeding that of their habitat loss, so that they are now absent from large areas of suitable habitat. Twenty-four of them are associated with slow-flowing rivers and other wetlands. These areas are preferentially settled and exploited by people and their birds are thus under elevated threat from hunting, habitat clearance and disturbance. Other factors may explain the declines of several birds (Pied Kingfisher Ceryle nidis and Plain Martin Riparia palndicola) in these habitats. Most other decreasing species inhabit open deciduous forest or scrub, which also experience heavy human use. Hornbills, however, occupy dense forest but also have declined, perhaps because their conspicuousness, flocking behaviour and low reproductive rate all magnify the effects of hunting. Further species have doubtless declined, but historical data are too patchy to demonstrate this. The major threats to birds in Laos include logging, accelerated forest clearance and fragmentation on a large scale (for subsistence and commercial purposes), intensification of wetland use and widespread unrestricted hunting. A new force with the potential to be exceedingly damaging is a proposed programme of over 50 hydropower developments. These will inundate and fragment large areas of intact habitat, force farmers to clear fresh land elsewhere and open up access to some of the nation's most remote and pristine wildlife habitats. Conservation measures will revolve around implementing management within the recently established protected areas, resisting commercial exploitation within them, and expanding the network to cover currently under-represented habitats. For a few species, measures beyond the reserves system are imperative: these include species requiring large rivers (e.g. Great Thick-knee Esncus reatrvirostris, terns and River Lapwing) and wide-ranging large waterbirds (e.g. storks, ibises and cranes). Further status surveys for all species are needed throughout Laos and are particularly urgent for large waterbirds and everywhere in North Laos.

We developed a population risk model to examine influence of population size, catastrophes (epidemics and hurricanes), and habitat management scenarios on Florida scrub-jay populations. Extinction risk declined rapidly when initial population sizes increased from 20 to 100 breeding pairs. Hurricanes increased extinction risk for coastal populations by 10-30% compared to inland populations. Our results suggested that habitat in poor condition was unlikely support a population for more than a few decades. Poor habitat quality conditions were common throughout the species' range because of fire suppression or inadequate fire management. Habitat management was more effective than habitat restoration because population recovery occurred slowly after restoration and only if habitat was restored to optimal conditions. Sensitivity analyses showed that fecundity and survival of experienced breeders without helpers (adult nonbreeders) were the most important model parameters. Slow recovery rates occurred because helpers were the only rapid source of colonists in restored habitat and because an absence of helpers reduced breeder survival and fecundity. Small population sizes and habitat degradation make the Florida scrub-jay vulnerable to rangewide decline and extinction unless habitat is protected, restored, and managed to maintain optimal conditions.","Aphelocoma coerculescens; Extinction risk; Fire management; Habitat quality; Population viability; Scrub-jay",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033436372

Habitat structure, breeding bird species composition, richness, and relative abundance were compared in 1994 and 1995 between six independent pairs of sites, each pair consisting of a recently burned aspen site and a control site. Burned sites typically had lower canopy cover and depth, greater snag densities and aspen regeneration, and less shrub growth. We observed 45 diurnal woodland bird species overall. Western Wood-Pewees (Contopus sordidulus) and Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus) were detected significantly less often in the burned sites, while Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) and Pine Siskins (Carduelis pinus) were detected significantly more often in the burned sites. Orange-crowned Warblers (Vermivora celata), Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), and chickadees (Poecile spp.) were significantly less abundant in the burned aspen when burn size or year was factored into the analysis. For many other commonly detected species, we had relatively low power to detect meaningful differences in abundance between recently burned and unburned aspen stands.

In pine rocklands, invasion on an exotic plant has produced a shady canopy inimical to some native plants and has catastrophically altered fire regimes. In scrub communities, maintenance of the natural fire regime has been impeded by fragmentation and by suppression of fires in altered adjacent habitats. Destruction of the lichen-dominated ground cover is also important. In longleaf pine forests, fragmentation has again interfered with the fire regime that maintains the system and has also generated increased herbivory on plant species and increased predation on nests of many animal species. Road kills of several animal species are now a major source of mortality, while an endangered woodpecker has difficulty finding suitable trees in the reduced and fragmented forest. It is unlikely that corridors would alleviate the problems encountered by species in the longleaf system. A more promising approach would be to manage the entire landscape for conservation, and not only small, isolated reserves.

However, at times, management for threatened and endangered species precludes consideration of other species. We investigated how managing for red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and biodiversity at the Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina, affected communities of bird species that use early-successional scrub habitat (hereafter, scrub-successional species). Management for red-cockaded woodpeckers at the SRS involved both (1) manipulating mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)-wiregrass (Andropogon spp.) stands via canopy thinning, removal of midstory trees, and prescribed burning; and (2) even-aged timber harvesting. The former management practice encouraged red-cockaded woodpeckers to establish new colonies in previously unoccupied stands (hereafter, 'recruitment' stands). The latter management practice is used to remove off-site planted pines and replant with preferred longleaf pines. We conducted a constant-effort mist net study in recruitment and regenerating stands (stands clearcut and planted with longleaf pine) during the breeding seasons of 1995-96. We hypothesized that the scrub-successional bird community in recruitment stands would have greater species richness and higher survival and reproductive rates per species than in regenerating stands. However, recruitment stands always had fewer scrub-successional species (1995: 36 species; 1996: 31 species) than regenerating stands (1995: 54 species; 1996: 55 species), and all species that occurred in recruitment stands also occurred in regenerating stands. Species which commonly occurred in both recruitment and regenerating stands had similar adult:juvenile ratios (P > 0.15) and relative proportion of adults in breeding condition (P > 0.05). We detected no difference in survival rates of Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis), indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea), and of 'combined' scrub-successional birds between stand types (P > 0.05).

Artificial cavities and translocations are intensive management techniques that will be used together. Implementation of the RCW recovery strategy should benefit threatened, endangered or sensitive species, as well as overall biological diversity.

TGC 1T4, Canada","A current paradigm in conservation biology is that forest harvest practices that better approximate natural disturbance processes are more likely to conserve biodiversity. We contrasted bird communities in three replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having ≥95% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested sites retaining an average of 6% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance. Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats were associated primarily with 1-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P. arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood forest. Notably, Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius) had higher densities on postwildfire than on postharvest stands. Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina), Black-and-White Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Red-start (Setophaga ruticilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludoviciana), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), and Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) had higher densities on postharvest stands, possibly due to the greater abundance, after harvest, of larger live residual trees and a taller and more dense shrub layer. Harvest designed to approximate stand-replacing fires may require the retention of more snags than is currently practiced. New approaches to fire salvage logging are also required to ensure adequate retention of standing dead trees on the landscape.","Avian communities; Boreal forest management; Fire salvage; Forest harvest practices; Natural disturbance; TWINSPAN; Vegetation structure; Wildfire",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033178333

The productivity of the population was low during 1989-1990; 0.69 young were fledged per nesting attempt. To assess the adequacy of foraging habitat, forest structure was measured in an area with a high density of groups (1.95/km2) in 1990 and in an area where the group density had declined from 2.92 groups/km2 in 1977 to 0.74 groups/km2 in 1990.

Cluster sites had longer nearest neighbor distances in 1977 than in 1990, which may indicate that isolation by distance reduces the influx of dispersing breeders from elsewhere in the population.

Recently disturbed areas were characterized by open-land bird assemblages dominated by Neotropical migrants, which reached their highest abundance in clearcuts. Moreover, logged stands were distinguished from burned sites by the absence of cavity-nesting birds Forest-bird assemblages reestablished themselves as soon as young spruces reached the sapling stage. However, the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus), and Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) were restricted to mature stands or recent burns and are thus likely to be negatively affected by modern forestry, which revolves fire suppression and short logging rotations.

During an ongoing study of habitat use by Lumholtz's tree-kangaroos (Dendrolagus lumholtzi), an unexpected opportunity arose to study the responses of this rare arboreal marsupial to habitat disruption. The study took place on the Atherton Tableland in north Queensland, Australia, when half of a 20-ha rainforest fragment was unexpectedly clearfelled by the landowner. Prior to clearing, six animals had been fitted with radiocollars to monitor their locations and activity within the fragment. Most animals responded to clearing by remaining in trees until just before they were felled. Animals then fled for short distances (mean = 33 m), but returned to their home ranges within 12-24 h. Nine additional resident animals were captured after forest clearing and radiocollared, and along with the original animals were tracked at ca. 12-h intervals for several months. Six females and five males directly affected by clearing continued to use their original home ranges, amongst the 1-2 m-tall tangles of woody debris. Contrary to expectations, animals did not relocate to nearby forest blocks, and only one animal established a completely new home range. Mortality rates of affected animals appeared to increase after clearfelling, with at least four perishing from attacks by domestic dogs or dingoes. Although some surviving tree-kangaroos lived within the debris for several months, their prospects for long-term survival were poor as the debris was eventually burnt to create cattle pasture, destroying the already modified habitat and leaving them vulnerable to predators. The remarkably strong site-tenacity of this species suggests that habitat availability will be critically limiting to their populations, and that displaced animals will have limited prospects for survival.","Dendrolagus lumholtzi; Folivore; Habitat fragmentation; Habitat loss; Lumholtz's tree-kangaroo; Tropical rainforest",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032743158

Lucanids are saproxylic beetles, dependent on dead, moribund and decaying wood. Samples taken from old-growth forest and from a chronosequence of sites regenerating after logging, in each forest type, were used to compare the species richness and abundance of the lucanid assemblages. In both forest types, species richness and abundance was highest in the youngest regeneration sites (1-3 year), reflecting the species richness of the original and adjacent unlogged forest, lowest in the older (20-25 year) sites, and variable in the old-growth sites. TWINSPAN cluster analysis showed no clear distinction between regeneration and old-growth forest. The post-harvest slash and stump residue provided an important refugium and initial habitat, but our research indicates that some species may not maintain populations in the long term. Our results suggest that most species of lucanids will find a continuous supply of suitable habitat only in old-growth forests; and such species may become less common as clearfell harvesting leads to a replacement of heterogeneous old-growth forest with single-aged monospecific stands. Continuity of supply of wood in all decay stages, the maintenance of sufficient source areas, and biological connectivity between old-growth stands to enable dispersal, are all likely to be essential to maintain lucanid beetle community integrity. If similar principles apply to other saproxylic species of invertebrate, then clearfelling and slash-burning may cause a gradual extinction of an important element of the forest biota.","Conservation; Decaying wood; Forest management; Old growth; Saproxylic",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032706390

In 1950, the name was changed to the Canadian Wildlife Service, and under that name the agency has become internationally recognized. Although its mandate most clearly focused on the management of migratory birds, as defined under the Migratory Birds Convention Act, on game and furbearing mammals, and on the enforcement of international treaties for the conservation of species, in carrying out these responsibilities it has originated research on critical species and the factors affecting their survival throughout the country. Over 50 years, this has involved, among other studies, primary ones on Elk, Moose, and Bison in National Parks, the dynamics of northern species such as Caribou, Muskoxen, Polar Bears, Wolves, and Arctic Foxes, the population ecology and migration patterns of geese and ducks, songbird surveys, shorebird and seabird studies, major initiatives in the conservation of the Trumpeter Swan, Whooping Crane, and Peregrine Falcon, and limnological studies of the health of lakes to enhance fish production. As well as conducting research in National Parks for several decades, the Service has managed federal sanctuaries and wildlife areas including such well-known ones as Last Mountain Lake and those on the north shore and gulf of the St. Lawrence River. It has been a leader in research on environmental toxicology and effects of toxic substances on wildlife, contributed to the Canada Land Inventory Program, and developed innovative public education programs such as interpretive nature centres and the 'Hinterland Who's' series in print and on television. It has also enforced federal wildlife regulations, initiated habitat conservation programs, and promoted both federal-provincial and international cooperation in wildlife conservation. A major role has been coordinating endangered species evaluation and protection, both within Canada on COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) and internationally through CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora). It is a leader in proposed legislation expected to result in an endangered species act for Canada. Throughout its history its legends and accomplishments have bound the Wildlife Service into a unit whose employees' pride and passion have enabled it to survive resource reductions, decentralizing, and reorganizations and to remain innovative, vigorous, and relevant for the conservation and enforcement challenges yet to come. Its story is enhanced here by the reminiscences of many Wildlife Service veterans.","Canadian Wildlife Service; CITES; COSEWIC; Endangered species; Furbearers; Migratory birds; Sanctuaries; Seabirds; Shorebirds; Toxicology; Waterfowl; Wildlife areas",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0345188798

Our results also showed that Lewis' Woodpecker nests were more common in the later burn (1986) than in the earlier burn (1974).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032220293

Bird surveys between 1992 and 1996, the first since 1949, covered 20 main areas, with incidental records from many others. This paper reviews the status of all Lao species reported to be of elevated conservation concern (key species) in any of the following categories: Globally Threatened or Globally Near-Threatened (sensu Collar and Andrew 1988 and Collar et al. 1994), and At Risk or Rare in Thailand (sensu Round 1988 and Treesucon and Round 1990). Several additional species are covered which have clearly undergone a National Historical Decline in Laos. A comprehensive review of other Lao species was not possible, and some species which are in truth of conservation concern have doubtless been overlooked. Historical and modern records were reviewed and population trends identified where possible. Current global status listings (Collar et al. 1994) were supported, except that consideration should be given to changing Red-collared Woodpecker Picus rabieri and Sooty Babbler Stachyris herberti from Threatened to Near-Threatened. If the Lao situation is representative of the species throughout their range, then consideration should also be given to placing Ratchet-tailed Treepie Temnurus temnurus and River Lapwing Vanellus duvaucelii as Near-Threatened. Twenty-seven Globally Threatened species are known from Laos, of which there are recent records of 22. There are recent unconfirmed records of two more. Forty-seven Globally Near-Threatened species are known from Laos, of which there are recent records of 39; there are unconfirmed records of one further species. Five Globally Threatened and five Near-Threatened species were recorded for the first time in Laos in recent years, suggesting that further species of elevated conservation concern remain to be found. All species reviewed were placed in one of the four categories: At Risk in Laos, Potentially At Risk in Laos, Little Known and Not At Risk in Laos. These are assessed in the light of foreseeable threats; some species may move into a higher category of threat in due course. Forty-four species are thought to be At Risk in Laos; there are no recent records of four of these. Twenty-five species are thought to be Potentially At Risk in Laos; there are no recent records of two of these. Thirty-four species considered by this review are thought to be Not At Risk in Laos at the current time, whilst there is insufficient information to make an assessment (termed Little Known) for another 32 species. Laos retains a much higher proportion of forest cover than do most neighbours, including substantial lengths of almost pristine riverine forest in the Nam Theun and Xe Kong basins, extensive level lowland forest (especially at Xe Pian National Biodiversity Conservation Area and Dong Khanthung Proposed Protected Area in the South) and considerable amounts of slope forest at all altitudes. At least 27 forest species seem to occur in globally significant numbers. This is probably because the surveyed forests were large in relation to hunting and degradation pressures on the populations of most species. Logging of virgin areas, hydropower schemes and clearance of forest for cultivation will soon reverse this situation unless controls are established. At least 35 of the species under consideration have declined over the past 50 years by a magnitude exceeding that of their habitat loss, so that they are now absent from large areas of suitable habitat. Twenty-four of them are associated with slow-flowing rivers and other wetlands. These areas are preferentially settled and exploited by people and their birds are thus under elevated threat from hunting, habitat clearance and disturbance. Other factors may explain the declines of several birds (Pied Kingfisher Ceryle rudis and Plain Martin Riparia paludicola) in these habitats. Most other decreasing species inhabit open deciduous forest or scrub, which also experience heavy human use. Hornbills, however, occupy dense forest but also have declined, perhaps because their conspicuousness, flocking behaviour and low reproductive rate all magnify the effects of hunting. Further species have doubtless declined, but historical data are too patchy to demonstrate this. The major threats to birds in Laos include logging, accelerated forest clearance and fragmentation on a large scale (for subsistence and commercial purposes), intensification of wetland use and widespread unrestricted hunting. A new force with the potential to be exceedingly damaging is a proposed programme of over 50 hydropower developments. These will inundate and fragment large areas of intact habitat, force farmers to clear fresh land elsewhere and open up access to some of the nation's most remote and pristine wildlife habitats. Conservation measures will revolve around implementing management within the recently established protected areas, resisting commercial exploitation within them, and expanding the network to cover currently under-represented habitats. For a few species, measures beyond the reserves system are imperative: these include species requiring large rivers (e.g. Great Thick-knee Esacus recurvirostris, terns and River Lapwing) and wide-ranging large waterbirds (e.g. storks, ibises and cranes). Further status surveys for all species are needed throughout Laos and are particularly urgent for large waterbirds and everywhere in North Laos. In a global context, Laos has highly important populations of: Siamese Fireback Lophura diardi, Crested Argus Rheinardia ocellata, Green Peafowl Pavo muticus, White-winged Duck Cairina scutulata, Red-collared Woodpecker, Red-vented Barbet Megalaima lagrandieri, Brown Hornbill Anorrhinus tickellii, Rufous-necked Hornbill Aceros nipalensis, Blyth's Kingfisher Alcedo hercules, Coral-billed Ground-cuckoo Carpococcyx renauldii, Masked Finfoot Hdiopais personata, Grey-headed Lapwing Vanellus cinereus, Lesser Fish-eagle Ichthyophaga humilis, White-rumped Vulture Gyps bengalensis, Long-billed Vulture Gyps indicus, Red-headed Vulture Sarcogyps calvus, Rufous-winged Buzzard Butastur liventer, White-shouldered Ibis Pseudibis davisoni, Giant Ibis P. gigantea, Greater Adjutant* Leptoptilos dubius, Blue-rumped Pitta Pitta soror, Bar-bellied Pitta P. elliotii, White-winged Magpie Urocissa whiteheadi, Yellow-breasted Magpie Cissa hypoleuca, Ratchet-tailed Treepie, Green Cochoa Cochoa viridis, Jerdon's Bushchat Saxicola jerdoni, Beautiful Nuthatch Sitta formosa, Black-hooded Laughingthrush Garrulax milleti, Grey Laughingthrush G. maesi, White-cheeked Laughingthrush G. vassali, Red-tailed Laughingthrush G. milnei, Sooty Babbler, Grey-faced Tit-babbler Macronous kelleyi, Spectacled Fulvetta Alcippe ruficapilla, Rufous-throated Fulvetta A. rufogularis, Mountain Fulvetta A. peracensis and Short-tailed Parrotbill Paradoxornis davidianus. These are species either on the brink of global extinction; Globally Threatened or Near-Threatened but occurring commonly at many sites in Laos; for which recent Lao records are more substantial than those from anywhere else in a species's range; or have limited geographical range of which Laos is a substantial part.

A review of the literature suggests that, in many forests, conditions after exceptionally strong hurricanes promote the occurrence of fires of higher than normal intensity. While post-hurricane fires have not been prevalent or widespread in recent times in the southern US, a credible line of reasoning plus observations from outside the US supports the hypothesis of a hurricane-fire interaction, particularly in the era before organized fire suppression. The drastic effects caused by strong hurricanes and subsequent fire is likely to have been a significant part of the long-term disturbance regime of many ecosystems. Due to their infrequent occurrence and the difficulties involved in their study, these effects have been overlooked, minimized, or ignored. The hypothesis is presented that a hurricane-fire interaction influenced vegetation in specific ways in the presettlement South. Further, the present-day absence of this process may in part account for the continuing decline of certain plant communities. Opportunities for large-scale restoration of declining communities and ecosystems exist in areas where extensive vegetation change has already come in the form of drastic natural disturbance, such as that caused by severe hurricanes. Land managers may be able to facilitate the long-term process of restoring diverse, fire-maintained ecosystems by using a regime of frequent prescribed fires in areas impacted by strong hurricanes.","Fire; Fire ecology; Hurricane; Hurricane-fire interactions; Restoration ecology",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0032550303

Concern has arisen over impacts of large-scale conversion of closed-canopy forests to open pine-grassland woodlands. We evaluated how an ecosystem approach to habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected small mammals. During 2 winters we compared small mammal occurrence and abundance in untreated pine-hardwood stands to stands following wildlife stand improvement (WSI; midstory removal), and with WSI-treated stands in the first, second, and third dormant seasons following prescribed fire. Total abundance of small mammals was highest in WSI stands and was a more direct response to WSI (change in stand structure) than to fire. Increased species richness and diversity in the second year of this study was strongly related to both WSI and fire. No species was adversely affected by WSI or by fire. Rather, WSI and fire-reduced midstory, increased dead debris in the understory, promoted herbaceous production, and increased woody sprouting. Total community abundance, richness, and diversity were lowest in untreated stands. White-footed mice (Peromyscus spp.; primarily white-looted mouse [P. leucopus]) were the dominant species, accounting for 68% of the 611 individuals collected. Restoration efforts may be particularly beneficial to generalist species such as P. leucopus as well as to more specialized species, such as golden mouse (Ochrotomys nuttalli) and fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens) that historically may have depended upon pine-grassland habitats. Restoration of pine-grassland communities may enhance small mammal communities by reestablishing a landscape element that was present during presettlement times.","Arkansas; Fire ecology; Ouachita Mountains; Picoides borealis; Pine-bluestem; Prescribed fire; Red-cockaded woodpecker; Small mammals; Wildlife stand improvement",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031820038

Populations of the Bachman's sparrow began declining in the 1930s, with both a dramatic retraction in geographic distribution and the extinction of many local populations. Current land management practices in the southeastern United States often focus on the habitat requirements of the red-cockaded woodpecker without considering other species with similar habitat requirements (i.e., Bachman's sparrow). We examined habitat requirements of the Bachman's sparrow on Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, to determine if management practices directed at recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers are providing Bachman's sparrows with suitable habitat. Comparisons between active red-cockaded woodpecker clusters occupied (n = 8) and unoccupied (n = 13) by Bachman's sparrows showed that Bachman's sparrows selected areas with a dense understory of grasses and sparse midstory vegetation. Areas suitable for red-cockaded woodpeckers were not always suitable for Bachman's sparrows. Red-cockaded woodpeckers appear more tolerant of a hardwood midstory and do not require a dense cover of grasses and forbs. Prescribed burning is key for development and maintenance of the dense herbaceous understory preferred by Bachman's sparrow. In areas managed for red-cockaded woodpeckers, frequent (3-5 yr) burning early in the growing season appears the best way to increase habitat suitability for Bachman's sparrows.","Aimophila aestivalis; Bachman's sparrow; Coastal plain; Longleaf pine ecosystem; Picoides borealis; Prescribed fire; Red-cockaded woodpecker",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031921557

We studied diets of adult and nestling RCWs and their relation to variation in habitat. We found that ants were the dominant prey item by biomass (58%). Additional major items in stomachs of adult RCWs were other arthropods, fruits and seeds, and wood. Of the 4 species of ants present in samples, 74% of the biomass consisted of eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults of the arboreal ant Crematogaster ashmeadi. Territories burned more frequently had pine trees (Pinus spp.) with a higher diversity of ant species and lower proportions of trees occupied by C. ashmeadi than did territories burned less frequently. Also, stomach samples from adult male woodpeckers at frequently burned sites had lower proportions of ants, including C. ashmeadi.

The purposes of our study were to test for differences in foraging ecology of the black-backed, three-toed, and hairy woodpeckers following a stand-replacement fire and to evaluate the importance of such fires to the viability of populations of the black-backed woodpecker. In boreal forests of Interior Alaska, endemic population densities of three-toed woodpeckers are low (<0.1/ha), and black-backed woodpeckers are extremely rare. Following the Rosie Creek fire near Fairbanks. Alaska, in June 1983, both species increased markedly. Densities of both species briefly exceeded 0.2/ha and remained high in a 67-ha plot at the edge of the burn during the following 2 years. By December 1986, densities had declined to <0.1/ha. Black-backed woodpeckers fed primarily on charred portions of moderately to heavily burnt spruces and almost exclusively by excavating larval wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae). Three-toed woodpeckers fed on less-burnt spruces and foraged in and immediately under the bark; bark beetle (Scolytidae) larvae predominated in their diet. In contrast to earlier studies, our results demonstrate substantive differences in foraging sites, behavior, and diet of these 2 species. Foraging ecology of male hairy woodpeckers and black-backed woodpeckers, particularly females, was similar. In all 3 species, particularly the hairy woodpecker, females fed lower on trees and were far less numerous than males in the study area, which suggested intersexual displacement from foraging sites and habitats selected by males. In summer 1985, following initial adult emergence of the 1983 cerambycid and scolytid cohorts, woodpeckers declined markedly and were absent by late spring 1986. Our results suggest the black-backed woodpecker is extremely specialized in its foraging niche, exploiting outbreaks of wood-boring beetles in dying conifers for only 2-3 years after fires. Consequently, this species may be particularly vulnerable to local and regional extinction as fire suppression intensifies and programs of intensive salvage logging are pursued following fires.","Black-backed woodpecker; Fire; Foraging; Hairy woodpecker; Picoides arcticus; Picoides tridactylus; Picoides villosus; Salvage logging; Three-toed woodpecker",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031785512

The model is based on the hypothesis that self-sustained forest ecosystems can be (re-)created, and their biodiversity developed, if forest management can simulate the composition and structure of boreal forest landscapes by introducing and maintaining disturbances leading to naturally dynamic spatial and temporal patterns of forest regeneration. The major explanatory variable in the model is the effect of wildfire on sites with different fuel characteristics and climates found in the European boreal forest. Four levels of fire intensity are distinguished, based on mean fire frequencies. These range from extremely low in some wet tall-herb sites or sites at high altitudes or latitudes with a humid climate, where fire is absent or rare, to dry lichen-rich sites where fire occurs often. The model is called ASIO, after the words Absent, Seldom, Infrequent and Often, indicating the four levels. Three main disturbance regimes are distinguished in the European boreal forest, based on the complex interactions between probabilistic (e.g. mean fire intervals at different site types) and random events (e.g. where and when a fire occurs): (1) gap-phase Picea abies dynamics; (2) succession from young to old-growth mixed deciduous/coniferous forest; and (3) multi-cohort Pinus sylvestris dynamics. The model stems mainly from studies in Fennoscandia, but some studies from outside this region are reviewed to provide support for a more general application of the model. The model has been implemented in planning systems on the landscape level of several large Swedish forest enterprises, and is also used as an educational tool to help private land owners with the location and realization of forest management regimes. Finally, the model can be used to develop an administrative system for the monitoring of biodiversity in boreal forest.","Environmental monitoring; Fire dynamics; Indicator species; Wildlife management",Conference Paper,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031741215

We surveyed early-successional forests created by fire or logging for birds and their habitat during the 1994 and 1995 breeding seasons. We found that overall bird species richness and number of individuals (territorial males/ha) were higher (P < 0.05) in burned forests than in logged forests. The American crow (Corvus brachyrhynchos), house wren (Troglodytes aedon), common yellowthroat (Geothlypis trichas), clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), song sparrow (Melospiza melodia), Lincoln's sparrow (M. lincolnii), and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were more abundant in burned areas. The Nashville warbler (Vermivora ruficapilla), chestnut-sided warbler (Dendroica pensylvanica), black-throated green warbler (D. virens), and mourning warbler (Oporornis agilis) were present in greater numbers in the logged areas. We related these differences in bird presence and abundance to vegetation differences in the burned and logged habitat types. Burned areas had higher densities of dead trees, wider size ranges of dead trees, and greater heterogeneity in the shrub layer. Logged areas had higher densities of live trees, more live tree species, and wider size ranges of live trees. Red maple (Acer rubrum) was the live tree species found in greatest abundance in logged areas. If management goals include simulating natural disturbances like fire and maintaining bird populations, more dead trees should be left within logged habitats and the variability among logged areas should be increased.","Avian ecology; Boreal forest; CCA; Forest fire; Logging; Minnesota; Point count; Populus tremuloides",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031788853

Two periods of apparent decline of the Kirtland's Warbler this century, and a modest population increase on the breeding grounds since 1990, occurred contemporaneously with degradation and recovery, respectively, of the fire-dependent pine ecosystem in the northern Bahamas.

We studied the effect of firewood harvesting on population trends of birds during the breeding season in an oak-pine woodland in the foothills of the northern Sierra Nevada, California. During fall-winter of 1993-94, total tree basal area on 30 3.1-ha study plots was reduced by approximately 23% via removal of commercial-grade oaks, but all old-growth trees and trees with obvious nest cavities or woodpecker granaries were preserved. An additional 30 plots represented controls. We used point counts to derive a population index of birds 1 breeding season before and 2 breeding seasons after harvesting. We detected population shifts in 14 species (7 year-round residents, 4 breeding migrants, 1 migrant, 2 winter residents), of which 10 showed consistent population increases, 2 showed consistent population decreases, and 2 showed varying population changes in the 2 seasons after harvesting. Six of the species that increased on harvested plots appeared to respond to the presence of brush piles. Responses of other species were less clearly linked to a particular aspect of vegetation change. Although we found a negative effect of harvesting on only 2 species, the Pacific-slope flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis) and Hutton's vireo (Vireo huttoni), statistical power to detect anything less than total extirpation of many uncommon species was <0.8. Our results indicate that small-scale firewood harvests that reduce basal area by <25% and preserve nest cavities and granary trees have minimal negative short-term effects on most of the more common bird species present during the breeding season, but we caution that effects on uncommon species may have gone undetected. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the potential importance of site fidelity, brush-pile decay, and vegetation recovery in affecting species' responses over the long term.","Birds; Brush piles; California; Firewood harvesting; Forest management; Oak woodlands",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031831443

The forests were composed of several deciduous trees, especially oak, birch and beech (in the south), and, on poor soils, mainly of pine. Most forests were open grazing forests (pasture woodland), but ancient trees and large dead trees were still common. In some areas, rich deciduous forest dominated by lime and oak still occurred. During the following 700 years the forests were opened up by man, but biologically important structures of the virgin forests, viz. ancient trees, large dead trees and wetlands, remained abundant. During this period, biodiversity increased until the coverage of old-growth forest decreased to about 20 % of the surface area. The period 1800-1995 was a period of declining biodiversity, mainly due to local and regional extinction of species dependent on ancient trees and large dead trees. On the other hand, biodiversity among vascular plants and vertebrates changed comparatively little. However, these latter groups only comprise less than 5 % of the total biodiversity among macroorganisms. The very high biodiversity connected with decomposing wood, the fauna and flora of which has been affected most by the activities of man during the last 200 years, is stressed. In Sweden, the total species diversity connected with dead wood amounts to several thousand species, mainly fungi and insects. Restorations of old-fashioned cultural landscapes are now carried out in several places, unfortunately using the landscape of the 19th century as a model. During that period the biodiversity was lower than previously, since natural disturbance regimes with windfalls, fire, and natural water level fluctuations were no longer present. Therefore, the use of mediveal landscapes as a model for the restorations is recommended. This will lead to a higher biodiversity, and may be economically beneficial (wood products, meat, tourism). Studies of such landscapes provide insights useful in conservation and when developing sustainable forestry.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031392303

Alteration of plant communities through forest management and natural disturbances typically does not eliminate birds as a faunal group from the area affected, but will replace some species with others and cause changes in the abundance and species composition of bird communities. Upland, fire disclimax pine savannah communities composed of primarily longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) provide mature pines for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) while simultaneously providing grassland ground cover for Bachman's Sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) and Henslow's Sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii). On the mesic mid-slopes where there is an increasing presence of loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus echinata) pine and hardwood species, Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and White-eyed Vireos (Vireo griseus) find habitat in the understory and midstory vegetation, whereas canopy hardwoods and pines provide habitat for Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) and Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra). Transition into the wet bottomland hardwood forests increases the abundance of bird species associated with deciduous wetlands such as Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) and Swainsoh's Warblers (Limnothlypis swainsonii), whereas species associated with conifers and grassland savannahs are lost. Anthropogenic or natural disturbances that set back mature stages of forest succession can dramatically alter the species composition of bird communities. Depending on patch size, forest removal can initiate forest succession and provide habitat for early succession bird species such as Blue Grosbeaks (Guiraca caerulea), Field Sparrows (Spizella pusilla), Prairie Warblers (Dendroica discolor), Painted Buntings (Passerina ciris), Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), and Yellow-breasted Chats (Icteria virens). Although current data are inconclusive, patch size, forest fragmentation, edge effect, and landscape use patterns appear to influence bird communities by affecting area-sensitive species. Of greatest concern are forest-interior bird species that appear to be area sensitive such as the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea), Northern Parula (Parula americana), Louisiana Waterthrush (Seiurus motacilla), American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus).",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031434724

It is the only Noah American woodpecker species to become well adapted to a landscape that was relatively devoid of the substrate typically used by woodpeckers for cavity excavation (i.e. snags and decayed, living hardwoods). Its adaptation to use living pines for cavity excavation has expanded the use of this fire-disclimax ecosystem for numerous other cavity-using species. As such, the Red-cockaded Woodpecker represents an important keystone species of fire-disclimax pine ecosystems of the South. Historically, populations of this woodpecker and other cavity dependent species decreased dramatically with the logging of the southern pine forests between 1870 and 1930. Woodpecker populations continued to decline into the 1980s as a result of inadequate old-growth pine habitat, and suppression of fire which permitted encroachment of hardwoods into the previously pine-dominated ecosystem. Management practices initiated after 1988 have resulted in woodpecker population increases on Texas national forests. Cavity-tree mortality and southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis) infestation of cavity trees on the Angelina National Forest in eastern Texas were studied from 1983 through 1996. The intensive management activities initiated to stabilize severely declining woodpecker populations in 1989 may have increased beetle infestation rates of cavity trees in loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus echinata) pine habitat resulting in a net loss of cavity trees over the past seven years. Initial results suggest that beetle-caused mortality of cavity trees may be related in part to ambient southern pine beetle population levels in surrounding forest stands.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031435577

It attempts to identify presently recognized biotic and abiotic limiting factors. Then, through comparisons and applications of the principles of experimental design, it evaluates the relative importance of the factors and searches for new ones. The advantage of SCEA is that it frames ecological hypotheses in a context that spans population-, community-, and ecosystem-level processes while keeping the research focused on ecological factors that directly or indirectly affect the size of a focal population. In the case of the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis), which lives in mature pine forests of the southeastern United States, four types of environmental factors have been shown to limit its numbers, even on public land: (1) insufficient habitat due to hardwood midstory encroachment, (2) a shortage of suitable cavity trees, (3) loss and fragmentation of habitat, and (4) demographic isolation. As part of the research to identify other potentially limiting environmental factors in the Apalachicola National Forest of northern Florida, we studied a sample of 87 social units (each unit usually a mated pair of birds with or without helpers, but sometimes a single bird). Each unit was defending a cluster of cavity trees and a foraging territory of open longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest. We then developed regression models for predicting within-population variation in the size density and productivity of social units from data on habitat variation. We found that variation in the bird variables was not significantly related to the sizes or densities of pine trees in these territories. It was, however, highly significantly related to the ground cover composition and the extent of natural pine regeneration, both of which are indirect indicators of local fire history. This suggests that, in addition to the four main causes, environmental processes driven by the history of fire are also limiting the Red-cockaded Woodpecker population. Additional support for this idea comes from the fact that female Red-cockaded Woodpeckers on the Apalachicola Ranger District tend to lay larger clutches of eggs in the first breeding season after their territories have been burned. Because fire history affects soil nutrient dynamics, which in turn affect ground cover composition, our present hypothesis is that nutrient dynamics are affecting the health of animal populations in the system, including that of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker. The path by which this process operates, the particular nutrients involved, and its importance relative to other factors that limit the population need to be addressed experimentally. If nutrient dynamics are a previously unrecognized limiting factor for animal populations in this ecosystem, then the role of fire is not restricted to its ability to reduce vegetation in the midstory, and managers should acknowledge that different regimes of prescribed fire are likely to have different effects on animal, as well as plant, populations.","Apalachicola National Forest; Fire; Indirect effects; Longleaf pine; Multiple regression; Red-cockaded Woodpecker; Species-centered Environmental Analysis (SCEA)",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030616817

Nearest neighbor and line intercept techniques were used to sample trees, snags, and DWM. Overall snag densities (≤ 10 cm diameter at breast height) were greater in mature and old stands. Overall coarse DWM (≤ 11 cm diameter) counts were greater in young and old stands; volume of coarse DWM was greater in old stands. Analysis of spatial components of variation suggested that fires produced initially heterogeneous patterns in the densities of trees and dead woody material. The degree of spatial heterogeneity within and among stands decreased as stands developed to maturity. As a stand developed from maturity to old age, densities of trees and dead woody material retained spatial homogeneity within stands; however, they became more heterogeneous among stands. Comparisons of size distributions and decay patterns indicated that in young stands approximately (X̄ ± 1 SE) 19.1 ± 13.0 snags/ha (53.9%) and 48.5 ± 11.9 m3/ha of coarse DWM (79.2%) were derived from the prefire cohort of trees. Mature stands had 3.8 ± 4.0 snags/ha (5.8%) prefire snags. However, 50.4 ± 6.4 m3/ha coarse DWM were classified as prefire in origin (65.7%). In old stands, snags and coarse DWM were probably generated from the postfire cohort of trees. In general, the diversity of sizes and decay patterns of snags and DWM within stands was largely due to the mix of prefire materials and the postfire materials generated by self-thinning and senescence/death of large trees. To simulate some of the conditions that occur after natural disturbances such as wildfires, timber harvest strategies should, in part, attempt to maintain the biological legacy associated with dead-wood materials.","Boreal forest; Coarse woody debris; Downed woody material; Forest structure; Populus tremuloides; Snags; Wildlife habitat",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0030807758

We used trunk-window traps for sampling. Distinct beetle assemblages were associated with the different habitats. Median numbers of species or specimens caught did not differ between closed forests and clear-cuts, but individual beetle species occurred unevenly among the habitats. Several beetle species associated with open forest habitat, e.g. burned forests or storm damage areas, including species regarded as threatened in Finland, were found almost exclusively, in clear-cuts. Correspondingly, a number of beetle species occurring frequently in closed forests were not found in clear-cuts. We conclude that dead trunks left in the clear-cut areas may host not only generalist saproxylic species but also many beetle species specialized to warm, sun-exposed environments, and such species may not be able to survive in closed forests.

We demonstrate the hydrogeomorphic (HGM) assessment procedure by identifying ecological functions performed by mineral soil wet flats, obtaining quantitative field data from 19 wet flats (reference sites) in southeastern North Carolina, and modeling wetland functions using variables derived from those field data. We chose a subset of the 19 reference sites to demonstrate how HGM assessment can be used to measure ecosystem functions before and after a project site is altered and the degree to which ecosystem restoration can compensate for a reduction in functions caused by a project's impact. We also illustrate how HGM assessment can be used to determine the minimum area over which restoration should be applied to achieve a no-net-loss in function objective. This minimum area can be determined by dividing the degree to which a function is reduced through project alteration by the degree to which a function is increased through restoration. The ratio of wetland area restored to wetland area altered by a project impact (compensatory mitigation ratio) varies among functions and is influenced by (1) the magnitude to which any given function occurs at a project site both before and after the site is altered, (2) the magnitude to which any given function occurs at a compensatory mitigation site both before and after restoration is applied, and (3) the rate at which any given function is restored.","Compensatory wetland mitigation; Ecosystem restoration; Fire; Functional assessment; Hydrogeomorphic assessment; Impact assessment; Longleaf pine; North Carolina; Pinus palustris; Reference standards; Reference wetlands; Wet pine flats",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0031401097

Wildlife stand improvement (WSI; thinning of midstory and some codominant trees) and burning were primary management techniques used for woodpecker habitat improvement. We compared other grass, panicum (Panicum spp.), sedge (Carex spp., Scleria spp.), non-legume forbs, legumes, preferred woody, non- preferred woody and total standing crop response during 2 years in untreated pine-hardwood stands with that in treated stands after WSI and in 3 growing seasons following WSI and prescribed fire. Plant groups contributing to deer forage (panicum, sedge, forb, legume, and preferred woody standing crop) were increased by WSI 6-fold and by WSI and fire >7-fold over control stands (434 520 kg/ha versus 69 kg/ha). The standing crop of preferred woody browse was ≤20% of total standing crop in all stands, and was increased by 4-9 times by WSI or WSI and fire. Wildlife stand improvement alone increased herbaceous plant production. Fire further enhanced forb and legume production but initially caused declines in panicum, low-preference woody, and total woody standing crop. Total standing crop was up to 6 times greater on WSI-treated stands than control treatments (988 vs. 159 kg/ha), and this response was related to stand basal area and time since burned. Management of stands for pine-bluestem renewal should be patterned after presettlement landscape conditions using growing and dormant season burns and a periodic burn interval versus set 3-year dormant season burns. We recommend retaining mature oak-pine stands on mesic sites for acorn production within a mosaic of WSI and burned sites that dominate on xeric sites.","forage production; forest management; Odocoileus virginianus; Picoides borealis; prescribed fire; red cockaded woodpecker; white-tailed deer; wildlife stand improvement",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0029663445

Possum and glider communities at 22 sites in Australia and lemur communities at 18 sites in Madagascar were compared to evaluate patterns of community and species convergence in two shared habitats (evergreen and deciduous monsoon rainforests) and three derived habitats (Australian eucalypt forests and heaths, and Malagasy thorn scrubs). Arboreal mammals were classified into five dietary guilds for comparison of community structure and species adaptation. There is little evidence of convergence in trophic structure at the community level, but strong evidence of convergence in dietary adaptation at the species and niche level. Malagasy rainforest communities were characterized by a higher proportion of frugivore-folivores, and Australian rainforest and moist eucalypt communities by a higher proportion of folivores and folivore-frugivores. Possum and glider communities in temperate eucalypt forests and heaths supported a higher proportion of nectarivores and exudivores. Overall species richness was significantly higher in Madagascar. Four hypotheses are erected to account for these differences. The relative scarcity of frugivores in Australian evergreen rainforests is accounted for by the predominance of bird-dispersed fruits, and fruiting phenologies unsuitable for mammal exploitation and dispersal. Higher folivore diversity in Australian evergreen rainforests is associated with a more pronounced seasonal shortage of edible fruits and new leaf, which has increased dependence on mature leaf. Folivore species richness is greatest in Australian moist eucalypt forests where structural complexity, sustained by seral responses to wildfire, permits a high level of vertical segregation. Increased nectarivory and exudivory in Australian temperate eucalypt forests and heaths is associated with Mediterranean winter rainfall regimes, which permit year round exudate production, and not with the absence of nectar feeding bats as previously supposed. A lower overall species richness in Australian rainforests is attributed to a longer history of contraction and fragmentation by anthropogenic fires (monsoon rainforests) and Pleistocene climatic change (tropical evergreen rainforests). A high degree of convergence is apparent between genera occupying folivore and wood gouging niches, in terms of gastrointestinal morphology (e.g. Pseudocheirus-Lepilemur) and dental morphology (e.g. Dactylopsila-Daubentonia). Divergences are most apparent in adaptations associated with frugivory, including larger body size, diurnality, and bipedal suspension and leaping modes of locomotion (in Eulemur spp.). This study highlights the importance of founding effects, competition from other vertebrate taxa, coevolution between animals and their food plants, and differences in biophysical environments, as determinants of mammalian radiation and convergence.","Convergence; Diet; Frugivory; Gliders, lemurs; Possums; Rainforest",Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-17244376725

Results were compared with empirical distributions calculated from stand maps prepared in 1937-38, prior to significant timber harvest and effective fire suppression. The models predicted the observed proportion of 1937-38 old growth (≥ 200 years) within 10% but were poor at predicting proportions in 20-year age classes. These results suggest that negative exponential models based on empirically determined estimates of fire interval can be used to obtain approximate estimates of presettlement old growth if local fire history studies have been done.

I detected an average of 45 species per site and a total of 87 species in the sites combined. A comppilation of these data with bird‐count data from more than 200 additional studies conducted across 15 major vegetation cover types in the northern Rocky Mountain region showed that 15 bird species are generally more abundant in early post‐fire communities than in any other major cover type occurring in the northern Rockies. One bird species (Black‐backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) seems to be nearly restricted in its habitat distribution to standing dead forests created by stand‐replacement fires. Bird communities in recently burned forests are different in composition from those that characterize other Rocky Mountain cover types (including early‐successional clearcuts) primarily because members of three feeding guilds are especially abundant therein: woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters. Standing, fire‐killed trees provided nest sites for nearly two‐thirds of 31 species that were found nesting in the burned sites. Broken‐top snags and standing dead aspens were used as nest sites for cavity‐nesting species significantly more often than expected on the basis of their relative abundance. Moreover, because nearly all of the broken‐top snags that were used were present before the fire, forest conditions prior to a fire (especially the presence of snags) may be important in determining the suitability of a site to cavity‐nesting birds after a fire. For bird species that were relatively abundant in or relatively restricted to burned forests, stand‐replacement fires may be necessary for long‐term maintenance of their populations. Unfortunately, the current fire policy of public land‐management agencies does not encourage maintenance of stand‐replacement fire regimes, which may be necessary for the creation of conditions needed by the most fire‐dependent bird species. In addition, salvage cutting may reduce the suitability of burned‐forest habitat for birds by removing the most important element—standing, fire‐killed trees–needed for feeding, nesting, or both by the majority of bird species that used burned forests.

This period included 13 years of below.average rainfall, a number of minor wildfires and one that burnt 95% of the study area in January 1985. Annual survival of breeding males (mean = 70%) and females (mean = 59%) was higher during a period without fire. Survival of breeding females fell to less than 50% from 1987 to 1989, two years after the major fire. Survival of adults did not vary with age, but survival of juveniles was lower (mean = 31%) and variable (rànge 11.59%), particularly among those produced in the first breeding season after the fire in 1985. Splendid fairy.wrens bred during the Austral spring, with minor variation in length of the breeding season depending on rainfall at the start and temperature at the end of the breeding season. Clutch size varied little, but females laid more clutches in years when predation or brood parasitism were high, particularly in the two years after the major fire. Females produced a mean of 2.9 fledglings each season (4.7 in the best year), but productivity was low for several years after the 1985 fire. Helpers attended 60% of all nests but overall had little effect on annual fledgling production. Experienced females were more productive than novices, both with and without helpers. High reproductive effort, indexed by days nesting and caring for fledglings, did not reduce a female's chance of survival to the next breeding season, and annual reproductive effort was not correlated with female survival. Differential dispersal and mortality produced variation in the adult sex ratio. During the fire.free period 1978.84, the numbers of non.breeding males and females increased, because of a lack of available territories rather than a lack of available partners. Variation in natality and survival caused large variations in population density but the density of breeders was more constant (C.V. =24%) than than of helpers (C.V. = 57%). No decline in the population after the major fire of January 1985 was apparent until the 1988 breeding season; the number of groups declined from 1988 to 1990, some previously occupied territories became vacant and group size decreased. This delayed decline in population is attributed to decreased production of fledglings in the years after the fire and the gradual replacement of experienced breeding females by novices, which were less productive and suffered higher mortality. The major causes of demographic variation (brood parasites and fire) directly affected natality and juvenile survival; indirectly, population density, age structure, sex ratio and group composition were affected. Delayed dispersal, the proximate cause of cooperative breeding in splendid fairy.wrens, is favoured by this demographic environment. The widespread occurrence of similar demographic profiles may in part explain the high frequency of cooperative breeding in Australian birds. © 1993 CSIRO.

Fourteen of 19 new clans were occupying new colony sites <400-2440m from an adjacent colony. Pioneering or budding was suspected in formation of the new colonies, depending upon the distance the new colony was from another colony. Although only 1% of males were estimated to have colonized, colonization appears to be an important factor in the population biology of the species. The population increase was attributable to: a large inventory of pine sawtimber, availability of old trees for cavity excavation, control of hardwood midstory with prescribed fire, protection of cavity trees, and provision of adequate foraging habitat. The lack of any of these factors probably would have prevented a population increase. Despite a net increase in number of clans, colonies were being abandoned at a rate of 1.1% annually, a loss probably caused by encroachment of hardwood and pine midstories around cavity trees. On 21-22 September, 1989, Hurricane Hugo killed 63% of the red-cockaded woodpeckers. In addition, 87% of their cavity trees and >50% of their foraging habitat were destroyed.

This chapter reviews the rates at which CWD is added and removed from ecosystems, the biomass found in streams and forests, and many functions that CWD serves. CWD is added to ecosystems by numerous mechanisms, including wind, fire, insect attack, pathogens, competition, and geomorphic processes. Despite the many long-term studies on tree mortality, there are few published rates of CWD input on mass-area-1 time-1 basis. CWD is significantly transformed physically and chemically. Movement of CWD, especially in streams, is also an important but poorly documented mechanism whereby CWD is lost from ecosystems. Many factors control the rate at which CWD decomposes, including temperature, moisture, internal gas composition of CWD, substrate quality, size of CWD, and types of organisms involved. However, the importance of many of these factors has yet to be established in field experiments. CWD performs many functions in ecosystems, serving as autotrophic and heterotrophic habitat and strongly influencing geomorphic processes, especially in streams. It is also a major component of nutrient cycles in many ecosystems and is an important functional component of stream and forest ecosystems. © 1986, Academic Press Inc.

Diameter was the most consistently important difference observed between nest trees and trees available to each bird species. Bark-gleaning species tended to nest in well-decayed, softer snags; timber-drilling species nested in sounder snags. Two sapsucker species may have competed because their nesting habitat and preferred trees were similar. Some 67% of nest cavities occupied by nonexcavators were created by excavators (woodpeckers, nuthatches). Brown creepers Certhia americana did not depend on excavators for holes and chose trees that were different from those of other cavity-nesting birds.

A federal survey has estimated the volume losses sustained through the affected four years 1975-79 as 9.6 thousand million board feet (45.3 million cubic metres) on 6.3 million acres (2.55 million ha) of national forest. As the dominant host species in afflicted forests is Pinus ponderosa, the most destructive agents have been the parasites of this species-primarily the Western Pine Beetle (Dendroctonus brevicomis) and the Western Dwarf Mistletoe (Arceuthobium campylopodum). However, interrelationships between many stress-inducing factors may be of more significance than the direct attack by any single parasitic species on a host. Three approaches to the reduction of conifer losses have been studied. The first involves the use of silvicultural practices based on the elimination of susceptible, or high-risk, trees. This is most applicable in countering bark beetles which have the mobility and selectivity to reach potential hosts over large areas. The second approach is direct control, or the physical removal or destruction of parasites. The steady spread of dwarf mistletoe, formerly contained by natural fire, can only be slowed through pruning, logging, or burning. Bark beetles can be directly controlled if the work is done before new broods hatch and mature. Toxic pesticides such as Lindane have proven ineffective-mainly for economic reasons, but also due to serious reservations among some foresters about detrimental effects on the forest ecosystem. Sex attractants have been used to draw bark beetles into trees of which the removal is planned. The third approach, applicable to bark beetles, is biological control, or reliance on organisms-such as lizards, woodpeckers, predaceous beetles and their larvae, parasitic hymenopterans, and various Fungi, which in some cases the forester has options to encourage or discourage. At the very least these controls suppress bark beetle populations when normal precipitation patterns return. Unfortunately, the ideal of a natural equilibrium being reached solely with the use of biological controls is unrealistic. The most fundamental stress on the commercial forests of California is human use, in spite of occasional drought-accelerated epidemic losses to parasites. Salvage must continue to be aggressively pushed upon a reluctant industry, but, above all, more flexible and immediate responses to the first signs of increasing bark-beetle activity, coupled with indirect, pre-epidemic silvicultural practices based on the broader lessons of forest parasitology, must be developed. © 1981.",,Article,,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343582569
