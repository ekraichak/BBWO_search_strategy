Journal of Animal Ecology		2018	SEP 2018	87	5	1484-1496	1484	1496	English						Fire creates challenges and opportunities for wildlife through rapid destruction, modification and creation of habitat. Fire has spatially variable effects on landscapes; however, for species that benefit from the ephemeral resource patches created by fire, it is critical to understand characteristics of fires that promote postfire colonization and persistence and the spatial scales on which they operate. Using a model postfire specialist, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), we examined how colonization and persistence varied across two spatial scales as a function of four characteristics of fire regimesfire severity, fire size, fire ignition date and number of years since fire. We modelled black-backed woodpecker colonization and persistence using data from 108 recently burned forests in the Sierra Nevada and southern Cascades ecoregions of California, USA, that we monitored for up to 10years following fire. We employed a novel, spatially hierarchical, dynamic occupancy framework which differentiates colonization and persistence at two spatial scales: across fires and within fires. We found strong effects of fire characteristics on dynamic rates, with colonization and persistence declining across both spatial scales with increasing years since fire. Additionally, at sites within fires, colonization decreased with fire size and increased with fire severity and for fires with later ignition dates. Our results support the notion that different aspects of a species' environment are important for population processes at different spatial scales. As habitat quality is ephemeral for any given postfire area, our results illustrate the importance of time since fire in structuring occupancy at the fire level, with other characteristics of fires playing larger roles in determining abundance within individual fires. Our results contribute to the broader understanding of how variation in fire characteristics influences the colonization and persistence of species using ephemeral habitats, which is necessary for conserving and promoting postfire biodiversity in the context of rapidly shifting fire regimes.

Current forest management plans focus on nesting trees, but the incorporation of foraging trees would lead to a more effective management strategy to mitigate habitat loss for this species. We investigated the selection of foraging trees in forests managed for timber extraction and maintenance of wildlife values using foraging observations of 27 radio-tagged adult Williamson's Sapsuckers during the breeding season in 2 regions (Okanagan and Western) of their limited Canadian range. Characteristics of foraging trees (88% of observations on live trees, 11% on dead trees) differed with foraging mode. Large, live Douglas-firs (Pseudotsuga menziesii; >= 22.5 cm dbh) were used for gleaning and sap feeding on tree trunks in both regions, whereas trees used for trunk pecking were mostly large, senescent western larches (Larix occidentalis) in the Okanagan region and large, dead ponderosa pines (Pinus ponderosa) in the Western region (average dbh = 46 cm). For overall foraging activities, Williamson's Sapsuckers selected large, live Douglas-firs with signs of resin exudation and blistering (pitching), and avoided live lodgepole pines (Pinus contorta), quaking aspens (Populus tremuloides), and ponderosa pines. Larger trees and standing dead conifer trees were reused more often for foraging than smaller and live trees. The quality of Williamson's Sapsucker habitat could decrease over the long term if forest management practices reduce the overall size of trees or alter tree species composition to promote lodgepole pine. Forest management should focus on retaining and promoting large live Douglas-fir trees and large senescent or standing dead conifers (also used for nesting), which can be achieved by using thinning, prescribed fire, partial harvesting, and tree retention strategies.

Our objective was to map abundance and provide a population estimate of black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains of South Dakota and Wyoming, USA. We conducted 3,666 and 3,384 5-minute point count surveys from late-March to late-June in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We characterized vegetation around each point using geographic information system-derived landscape variables and fit 3-level hierarchical time-removal models in R package unmarked using gmultmix. The global abundance model received the most support and included year, latitude, and percent area of green trees, beetle-killed trees, dead trees, 1- to 2-year-old wildfire, 3-year-old wildfire, and 4- to 5-year-old wildfire. Points with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees had the greatest density of black-backed woodpeckers, followed by 1- to 2-year-old wildfires. After 4 years, areas burned by wildfire supported lower densities of black-backed woodpeckers than undisturbed forests. Mean density was 0.528birds/km(2) in 2015 and 0.626birds/km(2) in 2016. There were an estimated 2,920 and 3,439 black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills and Bear Lodge Mountains in 2015 and 2016, respectively. We suggest areas with high percent cover of beetle-killed trees may support high densities of black-backed woodpeckers and are important to sustaining populations when the availability of recent (<4 years old) wildfire is declining or scarce.

(ginatarbill@fs.fed.us) ; White, Angela M.; Manley, Patricia N.									Avian Conservation and Ecology		2018	JUN 2018	13	1	Article No.: 16	16		English						The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a snag-associated species that colonizes and utilizes patches of burned forests typically within 10 years of fire. Previous research has indicated that salvage logging, the removal of dead and dying trees from burned forests, has a negative effect on nesting densities of Black-backed Woodpeckers. One strategy proposed to ameliorate the impacts of dead tree removal on Black-backed Woodpeckers is to retain patches, or islands, of dense snags within the salvage matrix, but this approach remains largely untested. Following the Angora fire of South Lake Tahoe, CA several snag islands were retained within the larger salvage prescription to conserve habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers and other snag-associated species. In this observational study, we evaluate whether these snag islands were effective at maintaining Black-backed Woodpecker populations following logging operations that covered 45% of the burned area. We systematically searched the postfire landscape for Black-backed Woodpecker nests for two years before and after salvage operations and compared nesting densities between logged and unlogged areas. Similar to other studies, we found that nest densities at the stand scale declined significantly in areas that were salvage logged, but Black-backed Woodpeckers did nest in both snag islands and in other peripheral unlogged areas, indicating that this approach may help balance habitat for wildlife with management needs at the scale of the fire. In this study, the removal of dead trees, which is usually implemented in the first two years following fire, did not occur until the fourth year, which may have also contributed to the persistence of Black-backed Woodpeckers postlogging.

Evolutionary Ecology		2018	JUN 2018	32	2-3	113-125	113	125	English						Wildfires underpin the dynamics and diversity of many ecosystems worldwide, and plants show a plethora of adaptive traits for persisting recurrent fires. Many fire-prone ecosystems also harbor a rich fauna; however, knowledge about adaptive traits to fire in animals remains poorly explored. We review existing literature and suggest that fire is an important evolutionary driver for animal diversity because (1) many animals are present in fire-prone landscapes and may have structural and phenotypic characters that contribute to adaptation to these open landscapes; and (2) in some cases, animals from fire-prone ecosystems may show specific fire adaptations. While there is limited evidence on morphological fire adaptations in animals, there is evidence suggesting that different behaviors might provide a rich source of putative fire adaptations; this is because, in contrast to plants, most animals are mobile, unitary organisms, have reduced survival when directly burnt by fire and can move away from the fire. We call for research on fire adaptations (morphological, behavioral, and physiological) in animals, and emphasize that in the animal kingdom many fire adaptations are likely to be behavioral. While it may be difficult to discern these adaptations from other animal behaviors, making this distinction is fundamental if we want to understand the role of fire in shaping biodiversity. Developing this understanding is critical to how we view and manage our ecosystems in the face of current global and fire regime changes.

Such models do not usually represent important processes explicitly related to climate change and harvesting, which limits their potential for predicting and understanding the future of boreal bird assemblages at the landscape scale. In this study, we attempted to assess the cumulative and specific impacts of both harvesting and climate-induced changes on wildfires and standlevel processes (e.g., reproduction, growth) in the boreal forest of eastern Canada. The projected changes in these landscape-and stand-scale processes (referred to as "drivers of change") were then assessed for their impacts on future habitats and potential productivity of black-backed woodpecker (BBWO; Picoides arcticus), a focal species representative of deadwood and old-growth biodiversity in eastern Canada. Forest attributes were simulated using a forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, and were used to infer future landscape suitability to BBWO under three anthropogenic climate forcing scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5), compared to the historical baseline. We found climate change is likely to be detrimental for BBWO, with up to 92% decline in potential productivity under the worst-case climate forcing scenario (RCP 8.5). However, large declines were also projected under baseline climate, underlining the importance of harvest in determining future BBWO productivity. Present-day harvesting practices were the single most important cause of declining areas of old-growth coniferous forest, and hence appeared as the single most important driver of future BBWO productivity, regardless of the climate scenario. Climate-induced increases in fire activity would further promote young, deciduous stands at the expense of old-growth coniferous stands. This suggests that the biodiversity associated with deadwood and old-growth boreal forests may be greatly altered by the cumulative impacts of natural and anthropogenic disturbances under a changing climate. Management adaptations, including reduced harvesting levels and strategies to promote coniferous species content, may help mitigate these cumulative impacts.

Avian Conservation and Ecology		2017	DEC 2017	12	2				English						A major challenge for protected areas is providing wildlife with enough suitable habitat to cope with stochastic environment and increased pressure from the surrounding landscapes. In this study, we addressed changes in local populations of Magellanic Woodpeckers (Campephilus magellanicus) occupying three national parks of central-southern Chile. We compared the breeding and postbreeding abundance of woodpeckers during the 1990s with the present (2016) abundance (n = 4 years), and assessed the extent to which abundance was explained by forest type and quality of foraging habitat (as quantified through the plant senescence reflectance index; PSRI). Results show a distinctive temporal variation in woodpecker abundance at each park, with local populations of Magellanic Woodpeckers declining by 42.2% in Conguillio National Park, but increasing by 34.3% in Nahuelbuta National Park. Woodpeckers responded to forest conditions within each park such that their abundance increased with high quality of foraging habitat, i. e., large PSRI values, and the presence of old-growth Monkey puzzle (Araucaria araucana) -Nothofagus pumilio mixed forest. Anecdotal evidence suggests that populations of woodpeckers in Conguillio National Park might have responded negatively to large-scale disturbances from recent forest fires affecting part of the forest area within park. Because stochastic events seemed to strongly mediate population changes, our findings suggest that regional conservation of Magellanic Woodpeckers requires expanding the current conservation area network in central-southern Chile.

Most restoration methods in this environment aim to emulate natural disturbances, and thereby promote the development of key ecological structures. However, research about forest ecosystem restoration is still in its infancy and the responses of many boreal species groups remain to be described. We established a large-scale field experiment to evaluate the short-term effects of two restoration treatments - prescribed burning and gap cutting involving the creation of dead wood - on breeding bird assemblages in boreal Sweden. We censused breeding birds using territory mapping during two years in forest stands subjected to the two restoration treatments, in untreated controls and in old-growth references (nature reserves) (n = 10 per treatment). Averaged over the two census years, we found 1145 territories of 36 bird species. Total bird species richness and abundance did not differ among treatments. However, prescribed burning led to clear changes in the structure of the bird assemblages. When dividing species according to four functional categorizations (migration, foraging, nesting and successional stage), we found that the abundance of long-distance migrants, ground breeders, strong cavity excavators and species preferring early-successional habitat was higher in burned stands than in untreated controls and gap-cut stands, as was the species richness of bark feeders and strong cavity excavators. In contrast, abundance of off-ground breeders and species richness of crown feeders were lower following prescribed burning than in the controls. The gap cutting treatment did not have any significant effects on the bird assemblages. Ecological restoration through prescribed burning can be a useful tool for the conservation of boreal forest birds, including the ecologically important strong cavity excavators (i.e. woodpeckers (Picidae)). Forest managers should therefore be encouraged to use prescribed burning as a restoration tool to quickly provide habitat for bird species adapted to natural disturbances in boreal forest.

We use density distribution models derived from a robust regional bird abundance dataset, coupled with habitat conservation plans, to evaluate a network of protected areas and to inform conservation and biodiversity planning in the greater Klamath Siskiyou Bioregion, an area recognized globally as a region of outstanding biological diversity. Our novel modeling approach allowed for comparisons of abundance of conservation focal species on federal vs. non-federal lands, federal lands that are protected to maintain natural habitats vs. federal lands managed for multiple uses, and seven protected areas of interest. Our comparisons highlight conservation opportunities for suites of species associated with coniferous forests, oak woodlands, and grasslands. Specifically, we found that species associated with oak woodland and grassland habitats, both habitats of conservation concern, were not well represented in the Bioregion's existing protected areas. These species would benefit from expanding the regional protected area network to include their associated at-risk habitats. In contrast, our results suggest that coniferous forests birds are well represented in the Bioregion's protected areas. We identify management opportunities specifically associated with the restoration of fire-adapted ecosystems that would benefit coniferous forest focal species on both federally protected areas and other multiple-use lands.

However, fire could alter the abundance and persistence of some arthropods, in turn influencing vertebrate taxa that depend on those arthropods as a food source. We used replicated prescribed fire treatments to evaluate macroarthropod response to time-since-fire in the fire-maintained longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. We sampled macroarthropod assemblages using vinyl gutter pitfall traps for 5 consecutive days in each month of the study (May-August 2014) in each replicate burn block. We identified macroarthropods to Order and dried and weighed the samples to determine biomass (g) of all taxa detected. We focused our analyses on 4 macroarthropod taxa important as food for wild turkey (Meleagris gallopavo): Araneae, Coleoptera, Hymenoptera, and Orthoptera. We used standard least squares regression to evaluate the effect of time-since-fire on total biomass of the 4 Orders (and we also evaluated those Orders independently). The analysis indicated that time-since fire had no effect (p = 0.2616) on combined biomass of these 4 taxa. Analyzing the 4 Orders separately, biomass of Araneae (p = 0.0057) and Orthoptera (p = 0.0004) showed significant effects of time-since fire, while Coleoptera (p = 0.9465) and Hymenoptera (p = 0.1175) did not. Parameter estimates (Araneae = 0.0084; SE = 0.0029; Orthoptera = 0.0137; SE = 0.0036) indicated that greater time-since-fire resulted in greater biomass for those 2 Orders. Overall, time-since-fire did not appear to have substantial effects on macroarthropod biomass. However, responses by Araneae and Orthoptera provided evidence that longer time-since-fire may result in greatest levels of biomass for some taxa. Our results indicate the use of frequent prescribed fire to restore and maintain longleaf forests is unlikely to pose risks to overall macroarthropod biomass, particularly if heterogeneity in fire frequency and spatial extent occurs on the landscape.

(karen.wiebe@usask.ca)									Journal of Avian Biology		2017	MAR 2017	48	3	431-438	431	438	English						Woodpeckers are considered ecosystem engineers because they excavate tree cavities which are used subsequently by many species of secondary cavity nesters for breeding. Woodpeckers have the choice of excavating a new hole or reusing an existing one, and this propensity to excavate (e) may affect community dynamics but has rarely been investigated. Using 18 years of data on a population of northern flickers Colaptes auratus, I tested six hypotheses to explain the propensity to excavate (e) in a landscape which experienced two types of disturbance: pine beetles and wildfires. Woodpecker age, breeding experience and mate retention had little influence on e which varied between 13-39% annually and averaged 23% for 1843 first nests over the 18 yr. Body size and body condition of males and females were not associated with e but rates of excavation declined seasonally, suggesting time rather than energy costs limited excavation effort. Reduced cavity availability mediated through high conspecific density coupled with wildfires triggered relatively high excavation rates, up to 39% but e decreased to baseline levels three years after the landscape disturbances. Nearly 2/3 of males did not excavate in their lifetime but apparently, e is great enough to balance the average rate of cavity tree loss in this forest which is 11% annually. Excavation propensity in flickers is flexible, but the birds reduce their work levels if there is a surplus of holes available.

Vogelwelt		2017		137	2	215-224	215	224	English						Multi-species indicators combining the population trends of bird species, e.g. for a given habitat, are a valuable tool for bird conservation. A smart selection of the indicator species allows such indicators to provide a good summary of the changes occurring in the bird community as a whole in that habitat. In this paper we report on the development of a forest bird indicator for Austria, designed to act as a proxy for the population development of forest bird species overall. For the selection of indicator species we used an objective, niche-based approach following two simple rules: (1) all resources used by birds in forests should be covered by the indicator species set, and (2) the species selected should be as specialised as possible. This approach was developed by WADE et al. (2014) on a European scale, and our work constitutes its first-time application to the forest bird community at a single-country level. The indicator species set was selected from a list of all Austrian forest species with at least 200 breeding pairs and was shown to be ideally composed of 26 bird species. As yearly population trend data is currently not available for some of these species, we re-ran the selection procedure, restricting selection to species for which trend data is available from the Austrian common bird monitoring scheme. This resulted in two equally suited indicator species sets, each composed of 19 species and differing from the other in only one species. The trends of these indicator species sets from 1998-2012 did not differ significantly from one another, nor from the trend calculated for the full list of forest species for which data was available - a moderate decline in all cases, ranging from -1.13 %/year to -1.30%/year. The indicator species finally selected were Stock Dove, Cuckoo, Black Woodpecker, Great Spotted Woodpecker, Wren, Robin, Nightingale, Blackbird, Western Bonelli's Warbler, Wood Warbler, Goldcrest, Firecrest, Collared Flycatcher, Marsh Tit, Crested Tit, Golden Oriole, Jay, Crossbill, and, interchangeably, Willow Warbler or Coal Tit.

We used a coupled human and natural systems framework and an agent-based landscape model to examine how alternative management scenarios affect fire and ecosystem services metrics in a fire-prone multiownership landscape in the eastern Cascades of Oregon. Our model incorporated existing models of vegetation succession and fire spread and information from original empirical studies of landowner decision making. Our findings indicate that alternative management strategies can have variable effects on landscape outcomes over 50 years for fire, socioeconomic, and ecosystem services metrics. For example, scenarios with federal restoration treatments had slightly less high-severity fire than a scenario without treatment; exposure of homes in the wildland-urban interface to fire was also slightly less with restoration treatments compared to no management. Treatments appeared to be more effective at reducing high-severity fire in years with more fire than in years with less fire. Under the current management scenario, timber production could be maintained for at least 50 years on federal lands. Under an accelerated restoration scenario, timber production fell because of a shortage of areas meeting current stand structure treatment targets. Trade-offs between restoration outcomes (e.g., open forests with large fire-resistant trees) and habitat for species that require dense older forests were evident. For example, the proportional area of nesting habitat for northern spotted owl (Strix occidentalis) was somewhat less after 50 years under the restoration scenarios than under no management. However, the amount of resilient older forest structure and habitat for white-headed woodpecker (Leuconotopicus albolarvatus) was higher after 50 years under active management. More carbon was stored on this landscape without management than with management, despite the occurrence of high-severity wildfire. Our results and further applications of the model could be used in collaborative settings to facilitate discussion and development of policies and practices for fire-prone landscapes.

Few studies have examined fire-caused injuries to estimate the probability of attack by insects. Scant data quantifying insect associations with one another, or with live and dead fire-injured trees, are available.3 We examined live and dead trees with varying levels of fire injury in wildfires in Colorado, Montana, Arizona and the Black Hills aiming to determine fire injury associated with insect infestation, co-occurrence between insects and insect association with live and dead fire-injured trees.4 Bole scorch height estimated the likelihood of attack by Ips spp. Diameter at breast height, bole scorch height and crown scorch height estimated the likelihood of attack by Dendroctonus valens LeConte. Diameter at breast height and bole scorch height estimated the likelihood of attack by wood borers.5 Ips spp., Dendroctonus valens and wood borers were associated with one another. Ips spp. beetles and wood borers were associated with dead fire-injured trees, whereas D. valens was often associated with live fire-injured trees.6 Focusing on certain fire-caused injuries may identify trees targeted by Ips spp. beetles, Dendroctonus valens and wood borers.

Habitat suitability models for nesting woodpeckers can be informative, but tests of model transferability are needed to understand how broadly models developed at one location can be applied to inform post-fire forest management at other locations. We developed habitat suitability models and tested their transferability for 2 disturbance-associated woodpecker species, Black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and Lewis's (Melanerpes lewis) woodpecker. Habitat suitability models consisted of weighted logistic regression models comparing environmental conditions at nest versus non-nest sites. We developed models at each of 3 wildfire locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho, and then examined predictive performance for each model at alternate ("application") locations. Models generally discriminated nest from non-nest sites well at locations where they were developed but performance was variable at application locations, indicating limited transferability. Models for Black-backed Woodpecker and those that included field-collected environmental covariates exhibited greater transferability than models for Lewis's Woodpecker and those that only included remotely sensed covariates. Transferability was also generally poor between Oregon and the other 2 locations. Limitations to model transferability observed in this study suggest models developed at any one wildfire location are unlikely to be generally applicable across the entire range of Black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers. Generally applicable models to inform post-fire forest management will therefore likely require integration of data from multiple wildfire locations.

One such species is the Lewis's woodpecker which is a species of conservation interest in multiple states and throughout its range in British Columbia, Canada with habitat loss and degradation proposed as contributing factors in the species decline. The purpose of this study was to model and map Lewis's woodpecker nesting habitat using primary (directly derived) and secondary (modeled using ground calibration data) remote sensing products, as well as contribute to the knowledge of nesting ecology for the species in a source habitat type. We found promise in the utility of lidar and Landsat time series modeled snag and shrub products in conjunction with additional lidar structure and topographic metrics for predicting nesting habitat for the Lewis's woodpecker across a post-fire landscape. Our selected model had a percent correctly classified rate of 83.3% and contained additional variables (variability in canopy cover and topographic slope) to those included in the Fish and Wildlife Service habitat suitability model (HSM) for the species (canopy cover, shrub cover, and density of large snags). We were able to apply the remote sensing products to map realized habitat relationships for this species of conservation concern in an identified source habitat type, providing a potential resource for local scale conservation and management efforts and adding to the regional knowledge of habitat selection for the Lewis's woodpecker.

It is often highly desirable to know not only where species are likely to occur (i.e. occupancy) but also how many individuals are supported by a given habitat (i.e. density). For many animals, occupancy and density may be determined by distinct ecological processes.2. Here we develop a novel abundance model as the product of landscape-scale occupancy probability and habitat-scale density given occupancy. One can conceptualize our model as fully packing a landscape with home ranges or territories based on habitat quality, and then subtracting territories based on a probabilistic process that accounts for the fact that species rarely exhibit full occupancy across heterogeneous landscapes. The model is designed to predict abundance at fine spatial scales, using resolutions equal to or smaller than a single home range or territory.3. We demonstrate this model on the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), a species of management concern linked to post-fire forests. Occupancy is derived from a regional monitoring effort, while density given occupancy comes from a telemetry study of variation in territory size. A Bayesian framework is used to combine independent occupancy and home-range size models and predict abundance of Black-backed Woodpeckers at 4 fires that burned in 2012 or 2013. Predictions are evaluated with independently collected survey data, showing that the model is successful at predicting both absolute abundance at fires as well as relative abundance within and among fires.4. The conceptual model presents a promising new framework for fine-scale modelling of density and abundance for other territorial yet elusive species. Telemetry and occupancy data are widely collected for many species, but rarely utilized in combination, and the ecological exploration of the factors that determine occurrence versus home-range size may provide useful biological insight. As applied to the Black-backed Woodpecker, the model provides a tool for resource managers to explore trade-offs in retaining burned forest habitat versus managing for other post-fire goals, such as salvage logging or reforestation efforts that require snag removal.

One such shortcut is the umbrella species approach, whereby conservation actions are geared toward one or a few key species, with the assumption that the entire community will benefit. However, fitness-habitat associations and resource use may vary across space and across management regimes, and so too may the utility of umbrella species as ecosystem surrogates. The federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) has been used as an umbrella species in the restoration of the longleaf pine ecosystem of the southeastern US. Restoration efforts were based on early habitat selection information in largely degraded landscapes. We examined patterns of resource selection of 97 social groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers in a restored landscape in northwest Florida. Similar to previous studies in degraded landscapes, woodpecker groups selected forest stands containing higher densities of large pines and lower densities of small pines for foraging. However, we found no evidence for another aspect of habitat selection widely documented in degraded habitat, the avoidance of areas with substantial components of hardwoods. These results align with new woodpecker fitness-habitat associations within restored landscapes and lend support to previous findings that current ecosystem restoration efforts in the study area, namely prescribed burning, may have reduced hardwood densities to below those at which they have negative impacts. The red-cockaded woodpecker has served as an effective umbrella species in degraded longleaf ecosystems by promoting management, especially prescribed burning, that benefits many other species. Whether it will continue to do so in restored habitat is not yet clear, but its tolerance of a range of hardwood conditions provides reason for optimism.	McKellar, A.

These metrics represent critical habitat components for various wildlife species of conservation concern, including the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), which is strongly associated with recently burned conifer forest. We assessed the potential of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) to detect and characterize conifer snags and identify Black-backed Woodpecker habitat using previously derived empirical thresholds of conifer snag basal area. Over the footprint of the Rim Fire, a megafire that extended (similar to 104,000 ha) through a heterogeneous mosaic of conifer forests, oak woodlands, and meadows in the Sierra Nevada mountains of California, we identified conifer snags and estimated their basal area from single-tree ALS-derived metrics using Gaussian processes in four major steps. First, individual trees were mapped using the Watershed Segmentation algorithm, resulting in 87% detection of trees with stem diameter larger than 30 cm. Second, the snag/live classification model identified snags with an overall accuracy of 91.8%, using the coefficient of variation of height and intensity together with maximum intensity and fractional cover as the most relevant metrics. Third, the conifer/hardwood snag classification model utilizing the maximum height, median height, minimum intensity, and area metrics separated snag forest types with an overall accuracy of 84.8%. Finally, a Gaussian process regression model reliably estimated conifer snag stem diameter (R-2 = 0.81) using height and crown area, thus significantly outperforming regionally calibrated conifer-specific allometric equations. As a result,-80% of the snag basal area have been mapped. Optimal and potential habitat for Black-backed Woodpecker comprise 53.7 km(2) and 58.4 km(2), respectively, representing 5.1 and 5.6% of the footprint of the Rim Fire. Our study illustrates the utility of high-density ALS data for characterizing recently burned forests, which, in conjunction with information about the habitat needs of particular snag-dependent wildlife species, can be used to assess habitat characteristics, and thus contribute greatly to forest management and biodiversity conservation.

Forest Ecology and Management		2016	MAR 1 2016	363		110-119	110	119	English						Information on the foraging ecology of animals is important for conservation and management, particularly for keystone species whose presence affects ecosystem health. We examined foraging by an at-risk cavity excavator, the white-headed woodpecker (Picoides albolarvatus). The foraging needs of this species are used to inform management of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in some areas of western North America. Past observational studies indicated that white-headed woodpeckers forage predominately on cones and trunks of large-diameter (>68 cm) pines in old-growth stands, although habitat selection while foraging has not been formally examined. We used radio telemetry to track forage substrate use among 37 adult, breeding woodpeckers for 176 h (10,576 min) in forest stands that had been recently thinned and/or burned with prescribed fire. We used discrete choice models to examine forage site selection and multinomial regression to examine consequences of foraging on nest productivity. Woodpeckers foraged on more than ten individual substrates and switched substrates seasonally, presumably to take advantage of prey availability. Dead wood and fir foliage were used commonly in the nesting period (86% and 68% of foraging, respectively), whereas pine foliage and trunk foraging dominated in the fledgling (66% of foraging) and post-fledgling periods (73% of foraging). Average size of used trees was 49 cm (+/- 20 cm) and pine cones were rarely used (4% of foraging). During the nesting period, substrate use (chi(2) = 1.49, df = 4, P = 0.83) and distances traveled from nests for foraging did not affect productivity (F-(3,F-16) = 0.61, P = 0.62), which was high even for birds with the longest (2.1 km) and shortest (0.39 km) maximum forage distances. Habitats selected for foraging matched substrate use, and woodpeckers selected areas with low basal areas of live trees in the nesting period, but high basal areas in the post-nesting period. The variable foraging that we observed suggests that white-headed woodpeckers are plastic in their foraging in managed forests, and this plasticity has no negative consequences for productivity.

(rsiegel@birdpop.org) ; Tingley, Morgan W.; Wilkerson, Robert L.; Howell, Christine A.; Johnson, Matthew; Pyle, Peter									Auk		2016	JAN 2016	133	1	69-78	69	78	English						Population age structure is important for understanding population dynamics, but can be difficult to resolve in landbirds due to the limited number of age classes discernible by examining plumage. In forests of western North America, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides articus) typically colonize burned areas shortly after fire, but densities decline within 6-10 yr. This pattern is often assumed to result from adult Black-backed Woodpeckers abandoning territories when food resources wane, yet long-distance breeding dispersal is relatively rare in birds, whereas longdistance natal dispersal is more common. To determine whether colonization of newly burned areas is driven primarily by breeding dispersal of adults or natal dispersal by young birds, we captured 57 adult Black-backed Woodpeckers in 6 burned areas in California between 1 and 8 yr after fire. We used patterns of multiple feather generations retained among primary coverts, secondaries, and secondary coverts to assign birds to 1 of 5 age classes (second-, third-, and fourth-calendar-year; after-third-calendar-year; and after-fourth-calendar-year). Population age structure varied dramatically across burned areas, with a preponderance of second-calendar-year birds in the 1 yr and 2 yr postfire areas, and a preponderance of birds at least 3 yr old in the older postfire areas. Poisson generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) revealed that the effect of years since fire on woodpecker age was highly significant (z = 3.575, P < 0.001). Our results indicate that natal dispersal is the primary means by which Black-backed Woodpeckers colonize recently burned areas in western forests, and that breeding dispersal is uncommon. The decline of Black-backed Woodpecker populations 6-10 yr after fire likely reflects the lifespan of individual birds that colonized the burned area, or of offspring that they produced in the early postfire years. Our discrimination of Black-backed Woodpeckers into 5 age classes confirms previous suppositions about plumage-based age determination in woodpeckers, and is likely applicable to other woodpecker species.

Journal of Wildlife Management		2015	NOV 2015	79	8	1286-1297	1286	1297	English						White-headed woodpeckers (Picoides albolarvatus) are important cavity excavators that recently have become the focus of much research because of concerns over population declines. Past studies have focused on nest site selection and survival but information is needed on factors influencing their space use when away from the nest. We examined space use by white-headed woodpeckers during the nesting (May-Jul) and post-nesting (Jul-Oct) periods and compared the role of environmental factors (e.g., landcover) and socio-demographic factors (e.g., age, breeding success) in home range size and selection of location. Average size of 99% kernel home ranges was 125ha (SD +/- 59ha; n=19) in the nesting period and 137ha (SD +/- 70ha; n=30) in the post-nesting period. Minimum convex polygons were generally comparable to or smaller than ranges reported from previous radio-telemetry studies with this species. Although bird weight and age best explained variation in home range size compared to other factors, neither parameter estimate was significant in our models. Thus, even though weight and age were the most-supported factors in our analysis, home range size was largely influenced by factors that we did not measure. We found that most woodpeckers selected home ranges within forest patches that had undergone a recent disturbance; these areas included forests that had recently been burned with prescribed fire by the United States Forest Service (82%) or subject to disease (16%). Most burned patches in our study were small (approx. 4.8ha) and occurred within otherwise live forest but had nearly complete mortality of adult trees. We suggest that recent forest disturbances, especially mixed-severity prescribed burns, may have been selected by white-headed woodpeckers because they created snags for nesting and future studies should explore this hypothesis. Because home range size was variable and not linked with productivity, it should not be used as an indication of habitat quality without more detailed studies on causal factors that affect space use in this species.

Forest Ecology and Management		2015	OCT 15 2015	354		130-138	130	138	English						Controlling broadleaf woody plant abundance is one of the greatest challenges in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) ecosystem restoration. Numerous factors have been associated with broadleaf woody plant abundance in longleaf pine ecosystems, including site quality, stand structure, and fire frequency and intensity, yet the way in which these factors vary and interact across a landscape is poorly understood. The goal of this study was to quantify the importance of environmental and management factors and their interactions on the abundance of hardwood tree and shrub species in upland pine forests managed for longleaf pine restoration in Fort Benning, GA. We measured understory, midstory, and overstory vegetation in 189 fixed-area plots, and we assembled descriptive plot data about soil texture classes, slope and aspect, and fire management history. We used classification and regression trees to model broadleaf woody species abundance. Regression trees identified fire return interval, soil texture, and slope as the most important factors affecting understory woody plant cover, with high mean cover occurring in areas with longer fire return intervals (i.e. less frequent fire), on fine-textured soils (sandy clay barns and sandy loams), and on slopes less than 6%. An interaction between soil texture and fire return interval was present and suggested that frequent fire was especially important in controlling understory broadleaf woody plants on fine-textured soils. A significant interaction emerged between soil texture and pine basal area as well, suggesting that the potential to release woody competitors with canopy removal was higher on fine-textured soils than on coarse-textured soils. The presence of hardwood stems in the midstory was most dependent upon time since burn. Other factors, such as the number of burns conducted during the growing season and topographic aspect, did not contribute significantly to variation in woody plant cover or density. Of the woody species encountered, sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua L.) was the most abundant, especially on plots with fire return intervals >= 2.6 years, on fine-textured soils, and at low pine basal areas (<9.4 m(2)/ha). Other species such as persimmon (Diospyros virginiana L.), winged sumac (Rhus copallinum L.), and southern red oak (Quercus falcata Michx.) were commonly encountered but at low densities. Our results demonstrate the general complexity of woody species control, but more importantly indicate site differences that could be used to prioritize prescribed fire application at the landscape scale.

Whereas recent nest web studies greatly increased our understanding of nest tree use by woodpeckers, knowledge on woodpeckers foraging requirements is much less developed. We quantified and compared tree selection patterns and foraging behavior of six bark-foraging woodpeckers downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), American three-toed woodpecker (Picoides dorsalis), black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), yellow-bellied sapsucker (Sphyropicus varius) and pileated woodpecker (Dryocopus pileatus) that co-occur in eastern boreal forests of North America. A total of 271 observation bouts and more than 600 foraging trees were recorded at three study sites characterized as mixedwood, conifer, and burn. Our results show that dead wood represents an important foraging substrate for most bark-foraging woodpeckers in Canadian eastern boreal forests. However, significant differences in individual species were found with regard to substrate use patterns, foraging behavior and associated prey. Woodpeckers were categorized according to their selection for specific stages of tree degradation, with the yellow-bellied sapsucker and the pileated woodpecker representing opposite ends of this gradient. The black-backed woodpecker showed the highest use of dead wood and was very specific in its tree selection by using mostly recently dead trees. We emphasize that providing foraging substrates for most woodpecker species not only requires maintaining dead wood but also paying heed to the underlying dynamics of dead wood (e.g. recruitment and degradation) in managed boreal forest landscapes.

Journal of Zoology (London)		2015	JUN 2015	296	2	95-103	95	103	English						Several studies have addressed the importance of woodpeckers as ecological engineers in forests due to their excavation of cavities. Although research in green, unburned forests has identified the influence of different excavators on secondary use by cavity-dependent species, little is known about the relative importance of cavities created by woodpeckers in recently burned forests. By excavating cavities, woodpeckers create habitat for secondary cavity users that can facilitate post-fire regeneration through seed dispersal, seed germination and regulation of insect populations that affect vegetative growth. In this study, we monitored 77 cavities created by three species of Picoides woodpeckers for use by secondary cavity species in a fire that burned in the Sierra Nevada, California. At each cavity we measured nest tree and site-specific parameters to determine if these characteristics could explain differential use by secondary cavity users. We found substantial overlap in cavity characteristics between woodpecker species, with the white-headed woodpecker differing most notably in their placement of cavities in larger diameter, shorter and more decayed trees in less dense stands than either hairy or black-backed woodpeckers. These differences in cavity placement may have resulted in the high diversity and large number of detections of secondary cavity species in white-headed woodpecker cavities. Black-backed and hairy woodpeckers were similar in the number of detections of secondary cavity use, although black-backed woodpecker cavities were used by more species than hairy woodpecker cavities. Secondary cavity use was high (86%) suggesting these woodpeckers, and the white-headed woodpecker in particular, can have an accelerating affect effect on ecological succession by providing valuable habitat features for seed dispersing birds and mammals, insectivorous birds, and small predators, thereby impacting ecological processes and functions.

Prior investigations revealed that the highest population growth rates of Black-backed Woodpeckers occurred in habitat created by summer wildfire, with intermediate population growth rates in MPB infestations, and the lowest population growth rates in habitats created by prescribed fire in fall. We tested whether apparent foraging success was associated with known habitat quality in order to assess the potential for food availability to regulate population growth. We counted the number of successfully captured wood-boring beetle larvae and "small'' prey on each tree that a Black-backed Woodpecker used for foraging and modeled these counts as a function of habitat, tree diameter, number of years postfire, and tree disturbance category. Total apparent foraging success (the sum of observed captures of wood-boring beetle larvae and small prey per tree) did not vary across habitats, but woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by summer wildfire were expected to capture 2.2 and 2.0 times more wood-boring beetles than woodpeckers foraging in habitats created by fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations, respectively. These results suggest that the availability of food resources may contribute to population regulation in this irruptive species. Furthermore, population growth in irruptive species may be highly sensitive to the availability of preferred food resources. Forests recently burned by summer wildfires provide relatively abundant food resources for Black-backed Woodpeckers and represent high-quality habitat for this species of conservation concern.

We quantified avian habitat associations across a gradient from open oak savanna to woodland, to closed canopy forest in the Cross Timbers of southeastern Kansas. We surveyed breeding bird species in 2012 and 2013 and modeled species-specific occupancy in relation to habitat variables. Several species, including the northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus), yellow-billed cuckoo (Coccyzus americanus), downy woodpecker (Picoides pubescens), Bewick's wren (Thryomanes bewickii), northern mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos), field sparrow (Spizella pusilla), dickcissel (Spiza americana), and orchard oriole (Icterus spurius) were associated with lower levels of tree density or canopy cover (i.e., savanna-woodland). Species associated with greater levels of tree density or canopy cover at some spatial scale included eastern wood-pewee (Contopus virens), white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis), blue-gray gnatcatcher (Polioptila caerulea), and indigo bunting (Passerina cyanea). Occupancy of eastern wood-pewee and blue grosbeak (Passerina caerulea) were highest at intermediate levels of canopy cover (50-m radius) and tree density, respectively. Occupancies of eastern wood-pewee, northern mockingbird, lark sparrow (Chondestes grammacus), indigo bunting, and brown-headed cowbird (Molothrus ater) were variously related to shrub density, which was unrelated to tree cover or density across the savanna-forest gradient. We expect the savanna-associated species would benefit from reduction in tree density to savanna-like habitat (tree canopy cover 25%) within forests that were formerly savanna.

Ecosystems		2015	JAN 2015	18	1	76-88	76	88	English						Forests are a significant part of the global carbon cycle and are increasingly viewed as tools for mitigating climate change. Natural disturbances, such as fire, can reduce carbon storage. However, many forests and dependent species evolved with frequent fire as an integral ecosystem process. We used a landscape forest simulation model to evaluate the effects of endangered species habitat management on carbon sequestration. We compared unmanaged forests (control) to forests managed with prescribed burning and prescribed burning combined with thinning. Management treatments followed guidelines of the recovery plan for the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (RCW), which requires low-density longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest. The unmanaged treatment provided the greatest carbon storage, but at the cost of lost RCW habitat. Thinning and burning treatments expanded RCW habitat by increasing the dominance of longleaf pine and reducing forest density, but stored 22% less total ecosystem carbon compared to the control. Our results demonstrate that continued carbon sequestration and the provision of RCW habitat are not incompatible goals, although there is a tradeoff between habitat extent and total ecosystem carbon across the landscape. Management for RCW habitat might also increase ecosystem resilience, as longleaf pine is tolerant of fire and drought, and resistant to pests. Restoring fire-adapted forests requires a reduction in carbon. However, the size of the reduction, the effects on sequestration rates, and the co-benefits from other ecosystem services should be evaluated in the context of the specific forest community targeted for restoration.

Avian Conservation and Ecology		2014	DEC 2014	9	2	Article No.: 3	3		English						Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a rare habitat specialist typically found in moderate and high severity burned forest throughout its range. It also inhabits green forest but little is known about occurrence and habitat use patterns outside of burned areas, especially in the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. We used point count and playback surveys to detect Black-backed Woodpeckers during 2011 -2013 on 460 transects on 10 national forest units. We defined green forest as areas that had not burned at moderate or high severity since 1991 and were more than 2 km from areas burned at moderate or high severity within the previous eight years (n = 386 transects). We used occupancy models to examine green forest habitat associations and found positive relationships with elevation, latitude, northern aspects, number of snags, tree diameter, lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) forest, and a negative relationship with slope. Estimated occupancy in green forest was higher than previously understood (0.21). In addition site colonization and extinction probability in green forest were low (0.05 and 0.19, respectively) and suggest that many of the individuals detected in green forest were not just actively dispersing across the landscape in search of burned areas, but were occupying relatively stable home ranges. The association with high elevation and lodgepole pine forest may increase their exposure to climate change as these elevation forest types are predicted to decrease in extent over the next century. Although density is high in burned forest, green forest covers significantly more area in the Sierra Nevada and should be considered in efforts to conserve this rare species.

While black-backed woodpeckers are attracted to areas affected by these disturbances, in the Black Hills they exist during interim disturbance periods in largely undisturbed forests. In 2012, a petition for listing black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills as a distinct population segment identified current population size and the population size necessary to minimize risk of extinction as key components of the decision process. Our objective was to estimate the population size of black-backed woodpeckers in the Black Hills National Forest of South Dakota and Wyoming during a period of relatively low disturbance (e.g., 2000-2001). The estimated population was 641 (95% CI = 405-990) and 456 (95% CI = 293-705) breeding pairs in 2000 and 2001, respectively. The average density of 0.12/km(2) (95% CI = 0.07-0.18) was similar to densities in other undisturbed forests. This population estimate provides a starting point for population viability analyses during periods of relatively low disturbance by fire or insects.

A large population of gopher tortoises (Gopherus polyphemus) is present, and we documented the gopher frog (Lithobates capito), American crocodile (Crocodylus acutus), eastern diamondback rattlesnake (Crotalus adamanteus), eastern indigo snake (Drymarchon couperi), and Florida pine snake (Pituophis melanoleucus). We recorded 68 families of Florida scrub-jays (Aphelocoma coerulescens) totaling 157 individuals and three active clusters of red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis). The easement and adjacent lands had 16 possible previous nest sites of Florida sandhill cranes (Grus canadensis), seven Audubon's crested caracara (Caracara cheriway) territories, five southern bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) nests, and six swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus) nests. We observed signs of Florida black bear (Ursus americanus), and a male Florida panther (Puma concolor) moved onto the property and died of unknown causes. More intensive surveys would be necessary to document additional wildlife species and to determine population levels. We recommend the timely use of prescribed fire as a management tool to maintain or restore dry prairie, scrubby flatwoods, and scrub habitats for wildlife, cattle, and biological diversity.

Condor		2014	AUG 2014	116	3	325-340	325	340	English						The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is a species of conservation concern that is strongly associated with recently burned forests. Black-backed Woodpeckers are known to have variable home-range sizes, yet the ecological factors related to this variation have not been adequately explored and may hold insights into the natural history of the species and the management of its habitat. During 2011 and 2012, we radio-tracked Black-backed Woodpeckers nesting in 3 forested areas of California that burned between 2 and 5 years before the initiation of tracking. Among 15 individuals with robust tracking data, we found that home-range size varied by an order of magnitude, from 24.1 to 304.1 ha, as measured by movement-based kernel estimation. Using an information-theoretic approach, we evaluated the functional relationship between snag basal area an a priori key resource and home-range size, additionally controlling for sex, age, and years since fire as covariates. We found that snag basal area alone best predicted home-range size, explaining 54-62% of observed variation. As snag basal area increased, home-range sizes exponentially decreased. This relationship held true both with and without the inclusion of 3 individuals that nested in burned forest yet foraged predominantly outside the fire perimeter in unburned forest. Snag basal area, unlike other potential influences on home-range size, is an attribute that forest managers can directly influence. We describe a quantitative relationship between home-range size and snag basal area that forest managers can use to predict Black-backed Woodpecker pair density in burned forests and assess the likely population consequences of specific harvest treatments.

Thus, the spatial configuration of resources within home ranges should influence bird movements, and resource values should be relative to their locations. We radio-tracked 22 Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) and related their space use and home range sizes to available resources while taking nest site locations into account. We developed utilization distributions (UDs) from nuthatch locations, and treated the area of each 95% isopleth as home range size and the height of the UD as relative probability of use. We fit models relating home range size to mean resource measures within home ranges, and used lognormal regression to relate intensity of use to resource metrics at random points by ranking linear mixed models. Nuthatch home ranges typically had two centers of activity. Areas of high use were associated with the density of recently killed snags (likely a foraging resource), recent prescribed fire, pine dominance, low tree stocking rates, and grassy herbaceous cover. Home ranges were generally large (median: 7.1 ha; range: 0.3-47.6 ha), and smaller home range sizes were associated with pine dominance and higher nest snag density. Predicted home range sizes decreased by 77% and 69%, respectively, when percent pine and nest snag density were maximized. Our results illustrate that movement decisions within home ranges are driven by both the availability and spatial distribution of resources, while ongoing savannah-woodland management is providing resources that are used by Brown-headed Nuthatches.

(bacs@uga.edu) ; Cox, James A.; Cooper, Robert J.									Avian Conservation and Ecology		2014	JUN 2014	9	1				English						Bachman's Sparrow (Peucaea aestivalis), an endemic North American passerine, requires frequent (<= 3 yr) prescribed fires to maintain preferred habitat conditions. Prescribed fires that coincide with the sparrow's nesting season are increasingly used to manage sparrow habitat, but concerns exist regarding the effects that nesting-season fires may pose to this understory-dwelling species. Previous studies suggested that threats posed by fires might be lessened by reducing the extent of prescribed fires, thereby providing unburned areas close to the areas where fires eliminate ground-cover vegetation. To assess this hypothesis, we monitored color-marked male Bachman's Sparrows on 2 sites where the extent of nesting-season fires differed 5-fold (> 70 ha vs. < 15 ha). Monthly survival for males did not differ between the large-and small-extent treatments, and survival rates exceeded 90% for all months except one during the second year of our study when fires were applied later in the season. Male densities also did not differ between treatments, but treatment-by-year interactions pointed to effects relating to the specific time that fires were applied. The distances separating observations of marked males before and after burns were smaller on small-extent treatments in the first year of study but larger on the small-extent treatments in the second year of study. Burn extents also had no consistent effect on postburn reproductive status. The largest extent we examined could have been too small to affect sparrow populations, but responses may also reflect sustainable metapopulation dynamics in a setting where a large sparrow population is maintained at a regional scale (> 100,000 ha) using frequent prescribed fire (<= 2-yr return intervals). Additional research is needed regarding the effects that nesting-season fires may have on small, isolated populations as well as sites where much larger burn extents (> 100 ha) or longer burn intervals (> 2 yr) are used.

We reviewed studies examining wildlife responses to MPB outbreaks and postoutbreak salvage logging to inform forest management and guide future research. Our review included 16 studies describing MPB outbreak relationships with 89 bird species and 6 studies describing relationships with 11 mammalian species, but no studies of reptiles or amphibians. We included studies that compared wildlife response metrics temporally (before versus after the outbreak) and spatially (across sites that varied in severity of outbreak) in relation to beetle outbreaks. Outbreaks ranged in size from 20,600 to >= 10(7) ha and studies occurred 1-30 years after the peak MPB outbreak, but most studies were conducted over the short-term (i.e., <= 6 years after the peak of MPB-induced tree mortality). Birds were the only taxa studied frequently; however, high variability existed among those studies to allow many inferences, although some patterns were evident. Avian studies concluded that cavity-nesting species responded more favorably to beetle-killed forests than species with open-cup nests, and species nesting in the shrub layer favored outbreak forests compared with ground and open-cup canopy nesters that generally showed mixed relationships. Bark-drilling species as a group clearly demonstrated a positive short-term association with MPB epidemics compared with that of other foraging assemblages. Cavity-nesting birds that do not consume bark beetles (i.e., secondary cavity-nesting species and nonbark-drilling woodpeckers) also exhibited some positive responses to MPB outbreaks, although not as pronounced or consistent as those of bark-drilling woodpeckers. Mammalian responses to MPB outbreaks were mixed. Studies consistently reported negative effects of MPB outbreaks on red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus). However, there is evidence that red squirrels can persist after an outbreak under some conditions, e.g., when nonhost tree species are present. For small mammal species associated with forest understories, responses may be most pronounced during the postepidemic period (>6 years after the peak of beetle-induced tree mortality) when snags fall to produce coarse woody debris. Postoutbreak salvage logging studies (n = 6) reported results that lacked consensus. Postoutbreak salvage logging may have an impact on fewer wildlife species than postfire salvage logging, probably because only host-specific tree species are removed after beetle outbreaks.

(karl.miller@myfwc.com)									Florida Field Naturalist		2014	MAY 2014	42	2	45-53	45	53	English						Nesting ecology of the Great Crested Flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus) has rarely been studied, even though the species is widespread and relatively common. I provide here the first study of Great Crested Flycatcher nesting ecology and nest-site selection in tree cavities in the eastern United States. I monitored 44 Great Crested Flycatcher nests in a mosaic of slash pine plantations and longleaf pine sandhills in Clay County, Florida. Nest sites were located in slash pine (52%), turkey oak (39%), longleaf pine (7%), and unknown pine species (2%). Most (73%) Great Crested Flycatcher nests were located in abandoned tree cavities excavated by various species, especially the Red-bellied Woodpecker (Melanerpes carolinus). Cavity entrance diameters averaged 6.2 (+/- 2.5) cm, with most (55%) measured entrances smaller than the minimum previously reported for the species. These findings are contrary to earlier characterizations of the species as showing a strong affinity for large naturally occurring hollows in live trees. Only 19 of 44 Great Crested Flycatcher nests (43%) were successful in fledging >= 1 young. Mean cavity height was greater for successful nests than for unsuccessful nests, and the primary cause of nest failure was predation. Most flycatcher nests in oaks were located in the understory <3 m above ground where they were particularly vulnerable to predation. More research is needed on the relationships between nest-site selection and nesting success for cavity-nesting species in fire-suppressed habitats with a significant hardwood component.

PLoS One		2014	APR 15 2014	9	4	Article No.: e94700	e94700		English						Wildfire and mountain pine beetle infestations are naturally occurring disturbances in western North American forests. Black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are emblematic of the role these disturbances play in creating wildlife habitat, since they are strongly associated with recently-killed forests. However, management practices aimed at reducing the economic impact of natural disturbances can result in habitat loss for this species. Although black-backed woodpeckers occupy habitats created by wildfire, prescribed fire, and mountain pine beetle infestations, the relative value of these habitats remains unknown. We studied habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probabilities and reproductive rates between April 2008 and August 2012 in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We estimated habitat-specific adult and juvenile survival probability with Bayesian multi-state models and habitat-specific reproductive success with Bayesian nest survival models. We calculated asymptotic population growth rates from estimated demographic rates with matrix projection models. Adult and juvenile survival and nest success were highest in habitat created by summer wildfire, intermediate in MPB infestations, and lowest in habitat created by fall prescribed fire. Mean posterior distributions of population growth rates indicated growing populations in habitat created by summer wildfire and declining populations in fall prescribed fire and mountain pine beetle infestations. Our finding that population growth rates were positive only in habitat created by summer wildfire underscores the need to maintain early post-wildfire habitat across the landscape. The lower growth rates in fall prescribed fire and MPB infestations may be attributed to differences in predator communities and food resources relative to summer wildfire.

We examined nest site selection and nest success of the species in this unique region to determine which habitat characteristics and management activities contribute most to woodpecker productivity. We used data from a single year (2010) to assess the relative importance of forest stand features, landscape features, management activities, and spatial characteristics affecting social behavior of the birds and found fire management practices played the largest role in habitat selection, while understory characteristics were most important to reproductive success. We also used data spanning an entire decade (2001 to 2010) to assess the relative importance of landscape features, management activities, spatial characteristics affecting social behavior of the birds, and environmental factors in habitat selection and productivity. We again found the number of fire events was most influential to habitat selection, whereas the location of clusters relative to the sand pine ecotone was most influential to reproductive success. Results highlight the well-known importance of using fire to maintain quality habitat for the species but also suggest some unique aspects pertinent to managing this southern population of red-cockaded woodpeckers.

Forest Ecology and Management		2014	FEB 1 2014	313		161-168	161	168	English						Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) are a disturbance-dependent species that occupy recently burned forest and mountain pine beetle (MPB) infestations. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of disturbed forest may lead to habitat loss for Black-backed Woodpeckers, which have recently been petitioned for listing under the Endangered Species Act. We studied home range size and resource selection of Black-backed Woodpeckers occupying habitat created by summer wildfire, fall prescribed fire, and MPB infestations in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We studied home range size and resource selection by attaching radio-transmitters to adult Black-backed Woodpeckers. We estimated home range size using fixed kernel density techniques (n = 28 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 19 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n = 27 in MPB infestations). We evaluated resource selection with a random-effects discrete choice model in a Bayesian framework (n = 5 in habitat created by summer wildfire, n = 16 in habitat created by fall prescribed fire, and n = 8 in habitat created by MPB infestations). Home range size was smallest in 1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat (mean home range size = 79 ha) and 2-year post fall prescribed fire habitat (mean home range size = 143 ha). Home range size was intermediate in MPB infestations (mean home range size = 307 ha) and was greatest in 3-4 year post fire habitat (mean summer wildfire home range size = 430 hectares, mean fall prescribed fire home range size = 460 ha). The relative probability that a Black-backed Woodpecker used a tree increased with increasing diameter at breast height (DBH) and basal area and was greatest on disturbance-killed trees. These results suggest 1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat may have the greatest relative value to Black-backed Woodpeckers and that MPB infestations may be more important as post-fire habitats age. We recommend retaining patches of 1-2 year post summer wildfire habitat that are at least 200 ha by exempting portions of recently burned forest from salvage logging. This recommendation can be accomplished by exempting salvage logging in summer wildfires <200 ha and retaining at least 50% of summer wildfires >400 ha. Ideally, recently burned forest patches should be composed of >= 27 m(2) basal area/ha of trees that burned at moderate or high severity, with at least 40% of the basal area composed of trees >= 27 cm DBH.

Western Birds		2014		45	4	296-303	296	303	English						The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is strongly associated with recently burned forest, which makes it vulnerable to salvage logging or other post-fire forest management that removes snags. As part of a larger radio-telemetry study of the species' resource use and habitat selection in a burned forest in California, we located radio-tagged Black-backed Woodpeckers at night to find and describe their roost sites. We found 14 unique roost locations during night-time searches for five individual birds. Description of the micro-site on the tree that the bird used was impossible at five roosts where we could not visually locate the bird in the dark. At the nine roosts confirmed visually, none of the birds roosted in excavated cavities. Rather, they roosted in sheltered spaces within burned-out hollows of trunks (5 instances), in the crook of a forked trunk (1 instance), wedged between adjacent trunks of two closely spaced trees (1 instance), in a deep, natural bark furrow (1 instance), and clinging to a trunk directly above a horizontal branch (1 instance). Eleven of the 14 roosts (79%) were in dead trees. Our results suggest that in burned forests the Black-backed Woodpecker may benefit if, during salvage logging, emphasis is placed on retaining snags with burned-out hollows, forked trunks, or other relatively unusual structures that may create crevices or other opportunities for shelter.

(kozj@yakamafish-nsn.gov)									Western Birds		2014		45	4	304-312	304	312	English						I compared characteristics of sites of Western Bluebird (Sialia mexicana) nests in natural tree cavities in burned and unburned logged ponderosa pine (Pin us ponderosa) forests along the east slope of the Cascade Range of Washington, 2003-2008 and 2010. Tree density and percent debris cover (litter and large woody debris) were greater at nest sites in unburned stands because fire kills live trees and consumes woody debris, and they were the only characteristics in which nest sites in burned and unburned forests differed. In burned stands cavities were oriented primarily east, whereas in unburned stands they were oriented randomly. East-facing cavities may be thermally advantageous early in the day, keeping eggs warmer when the incubating female is away foraging. Most snags containing bluebird nest cavities (73%) were advanced in decay and had broken tops. Of the cavities whose original excavator was known, 27% were excavated by the Hairy Woodpecker (Picoides villosus), 12% by the White-headed Woodpecker (P. albolarvatus), and 5% by the Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus). Only one nest was located in a non-excavated cavity. Of the 38 second nests, 76% were in the same cavity as the first, even though 38% of these first attempts were unsuccessful, suggesting that suitable cavities are limiting. My results suggest that bluebirds use similar nest sites in burned and unburned ponderosa pine stands and that abandoned woodpecker cavities are critical to the Western Bluebird in these managed forests.

Ecology and Evolution		2013	NOV 2013	3	13	4348-4364	4348	4364	English						To conserve habitat for disturbance specialist species, ecologists must identify where individuals will likely settle in newly disturbed areas. Habitat suitability models can predict which sites at new disturbances will most likely attract specialists. Without validation data from newly disturbed areas, however, the best approach for maximizing predictive accuracy can be unclear (Northwestern U.S.A.). We predicted habitat suitability for nesting Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus; a burned-forest specialist) at 20 recently (6years postwildfire) burned locations in Montana using models calibrated with data from three locations in Washington, Oregon, and Idaho. We developed 8 models using three techniques (weighted logistic regression, Maxent, and Mahalanobis D-2 models) and various combinations of four environmental variables describing burn severity, the north-south orientation of topographic slope, and prefire canopy cover. After translating model predictions into binary classifications (0=low suitability to unsuitable, 1=high to moderate suitability), we compiled ensemble predictions, consisting of the number of models (0-8) predicting any given site as highly suitable. The suitability status for 40% of the area burned by eastside Montana wildfires was consistent across models and therefore robust to uncertainty in the relative accuracy of particular models and in alternative ecological hypotheses they described. Ensemble predictions exhibited two desirable properties: (1) a positive relationship with apparent rates of nest occurrence at calibration locations and (2) declining model agreement outside surveyed environments consistent with our reduced confidence in novel (i.e., no-analogue) environments. Areas of disagreement among models suggested where future surveys could help validate and refine models for an improved understanding of Black-backed Woodpecker nesting habitat relationships. Ensemble predictions presented here can help guide managers attempting to balance salvage logging with habitat conservation in burned-forest landscapes where black-backed woodpecker nest location data are not immediately available.

PLoS One		2013	JUN 25 2013	8	6	Article No.: e67248	e67248		English						An exciting advance in the understanding of metapopulation dynamics has been the investigation of how populations respond to ephemeral patches that go 'extinct' during the lifetime of an individual. Previous research has shown that this scenario leads to genetic homogenization across large spatial scales. However, little is known about fine-scale genetic structuring or how this changes over time in ephemeral patches. We predicted that species that specialize on ephemeral habitats will delay dispersal to exploit natal habitat patches while resources are plentiful and thus display fine-scale structure. To investigate this idea, we evaluated the effect of frequent colonization of ephemeral habitats on the fine-scale genetic structure of a fire specialist, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) and found a pattern of fine-scale genetic structure. We then tested for differences in spatial structure between sexes and detected a pattern consistent with male-biased dispersal. We also detected a temporal increase in relatedness among individuals within newly burned forest patches. Our results indicate that specialist species that outlive their ephemeral patches can accrue significant fine-scale spatial structure that does not necessarily affect spatial structure at larger scales. This highlights the importance of both spatial and temporal scale considerations in both sampling and data interpretation of molecular genetic results.

We documented the habitat use and foraging strategies of Celeus obrieni, Kaempfer's Woodpecker, in forested cerrado (savanna) with patches of the bamboo Guadua paniculata near Pium, Tocantins, Brazil. We surveyed for C. obrieni, measured vegetation structure at 30 sites where it was detected and 23 where it was not detected, then compared vegetation characteristics through nonmetric multidimentional scaling and one-way analysis of similarity to determine whether C. obrieni was specializing on particular habitat characteristics. We studied the species' foraging and compared the abundance of prey in drilled and nondrilled stems to evaluate its dietary specialization. All sites with C. obrieni had large, tall stands of G. paniculata, indicating habitat specialization. Drilling most frequently on large, dry stems from 2 to 4 m off the ground, the woodpeckers consumed ants, mainly Camponotus depressus and Azteca fasciata, which colonize the internodes of bamboo stems. Habitat specialists are more vulnerable to habitat loss or alteration but can serve as indicator species for the reaching of conservation goals. Large stands of forested cerrado with patches of bamboo should be conserved for C. obrieni to be maintained. The patchiness of bamboo forest may impede dispersal of C. obrieni.

Tackling such an issue needs a cross-scale approach that takes the hierarchical nature of landscapes into account. Here I show the results of a cross-scale study focusing on the distribution patterns of ten forest vertebrate species (birds and mammals). The overarching goal of this study was to understand the strength of patch scale determinants of distribution, following the appropriate control for relevant landscape properties (e.g. habitat loss vs. habitat subdivision). I show how, after controlling for uncertainty in the detection of the species and for the role of landscape properties, patch scale variables still played an important role in determining occupancy patterns of forest vertebrates. For some species variation in the values of patch structure variables increased occurrence probability with only moderate levels of habitat loss, highlighting the fact that habitat management should be targeted towards precise landscape conditions. In other cases the effect of patch variables was strong therefore variation in their values always brought substantial increase/decrease of presence probability. Overall these results strongly suggest that habitat management should never be carried out irrespective of the properties of the surrounding landscape, rather, it should be carefully targeted towards specific landscape contexts (e.g. above a certain amount of habitat) where it is more likely to be effective.

In the forests of the Sierra Nevada, California, USA, there is relatively little information on the types of nest trees that these birds use in recently burned forests. From 2009 to 2011, we studied nest-tree preference by black-backed woodpeckers in 2 burned forests in the northern Sierra Nevada. For each of 31 nest trees and 389 randomly selected trees, we recorded decay class, diameter at breast height, top condition, and species. We also recorded the number of snags with >23 cm diameter at breast height within an 11.3-m radius of each nest tree and randomly selected tree. We evaluated nest-tree preference by comparing the characteristics of nest trees to randomly selected trees. Black-backed woodpeckers preferred dead but not heavily decayed trees and moderate (29-61 cm dbh) diameter trees. There was no evidence that black-backed woodpeckers had strong preferences for trees with broken tops or trees of particular species. Snag density around nest trees was higher than around randomly selected trees. Our results suggest that in conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada, the distribution of black-backed woodpeckers in post-fire environments is influenced more by surrounding snag densities than by particular characteristics of potential nest trees.

Forest Ecology and Management		2012	OCT 1 2012	281		100-110	100	110	English						Accurate measurement of forest canopy structure is critical for understanding forest-wildlife habitat relationships. Although most theory and application have been based on in situ measurements, imaging technologies such as Light Detection and Ranging (lidar) provide measurements that are both vertically accurate and horizontally extensive. We use small-footprint, multiple-return lidar from a state-wide dataset (1-m footprint, 0.11 point/m(2)) to characterize the vertical and horizontal structure of successional loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) and mature, fire-maintained longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests on the coastal plain of North Carolina, USA. The relationship between these characteristics and the federally-endangered red-cockaded woodpecker's (Picoides borealis, Vieillot) habitat preferences were assessed; as this species has a strong affinity for mature longleaf pine forests. Vertical structure was characterized by lidar-derived metrics (e.g., average and standard deviation of canopy height) and horizontal patterns of vertical structure were quantified by semivariograms and lacunarity analysis. Lidar metrics were compared with field measurements of stand structure and with woodpecker habitat use. We predicted woodpecker distribution using the Maxent species distribution modeling algorithm with elevation, landcover, and hydrography geospatial variables, with and without lidar-derived structural variables. Lidar successfully quantified canopy variation and differentiated between the structural characteristics of these two similar coniferous evergreen forest types (e.g. significant differences in maximum height, canopy cover, and size classes). Loblolly stands were found to have the tallest trees on average with a higher canopy cover. Both semivariograms and lacunarity analyses clearly differentiated between evergreen forest structural types (e.g. semivariogram range was 18.7 m for longleaf, 32.3 m for loblolly). By examining the immediate area around cavity nesting sites we found taller trees than those found across broader foraging sites. The species distribution model accurately predicted woodpecker distribution (tested with woodpecker presence, AUC >.85). The addition of lidar-derived variables improved the model's predictive power by 8% compared to the model based only on elevation, landcover, and hydrography environmental variables. We show that relatively low density lidar data are valuable for wildlife studies by characterizing and separating similar canopy types, describing different use zones (foraging vs. nesting), and for use in species distribution models.

Natural Areas Journal		2012	JUL 2012	32	3	247-259	247	259	English						Managers of natural areas often employ controlled disturbances as a tool to manage plant and animal populations. This approach assumes that disturbances are responsible for the structure of biological communities and that appropriate application of the disturbance will ensure the persistence of native plants and animals. If species in a community do not respond predictably to variation in disturbance regime, then management strategies based on emulating disturbance may fail to ensure the persistence of all species. In this study, we examined the efficacy of using prescribed fire as a tool for managing populations of breeding and wintering birds in the pine rocklands of southern Florida. We found that variation in fire history had little effect on vegetation structure and no effect on bird abundance. Instead, vegetation structure was more closely associated with water-table elevation and soil type, whereas most of the observed variation in the structure of bird assemblages appeared to be a function of degree of urbanization in the landscape. That the structure and composition of bird assemblages was independent of variation in fire history suggests that manipulating the fire regime, at least within the range of variability observed in this study, is unlikely to prove effective as a means to manage bird populations. In general, our results argue for caution in assuming that a single process can be used to control the structure of biological communities, especially in systems where landscapes have been substantially altered by human activity.

The restoration effort's economic effects are not completely understood. This study will provide the Forest Service with a framework for better communicating the biological and economic impacts of future forest plans and amendments. It also seeks to provide information on how shortleaf pine responds to different management regimes and the implicit cost to maintain the endangered red cockaded woodpecker habitat, and the economic consequences of transitioning from the traditional management regime to a regime which restores the shortleaf pine-bluestem grass ecosystem. The paper suggests by adopting the new pine-bluestem management regime, timber harvests in the pine-bluestem area decline by 25% during the 100-year simulation period, which will incur an additional implicit cost of $72/ha/year to maintain the red cockaded woodpecker habitat. An implied value for each pair of woodpeckers amounts to either $10,550 per year (for the desired 400 total pairs) or $16,880 per year (for the 250 reproducing pairs). Timber sale marking costs decline, while prescribed burning costs increase. The success of the pine-bluestem restoration requires the maintenance of a burning regime that prevents competing vegetation from occupying the middle canopy layer. Maintaining the pine-bluestem ecosystem will be difficult if environmental regulations become more stringent. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

August also was rarely sunny, mostly cool and very wet.A few pre-breeding migrants were still seen in June, including two male Common Rosefinch Carpodacus erythrinus seen in Luxembourg. On 15 16 June three Griffon Vultures Gyps fulvus stopped over in South Luxembourg. The months of June and July are also the time where the results of nesting become evident. Among waterbirds, at Harchies, a Squacco Heron Ardeola ralloides was seen and there was some indices of Spoonbill Platalea leucorodia nesting. In marshy habitats, breeding of Savi's Warbler Locustella luscinioides is probable and numbers of the Sedge Warbler Acrocephalus schoenobaenus cortinue to recover. Apart from the Hen Harrier Circus cyaneus, harrier breeding was not successful this year. Grey-headed Woodpeckers Picus canus seem extremely rare. Reproduction of the Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix was probably affected by the spring fires that happened across a large part of the Fagnes bog (reduced food supply, loss of nests).Two Short-toed Eagles Circaetus gallicus were seen in July, a young Red-necked Grebe Podiceps grise-gena was seen in August. There were unusually early sightings of Merlin Falco columbarius in mid-August.

With 100 radio-locations of four adult males, we used resource-selection probability functions in logistic form in an information-theoretic framework to model the Black-backed Woodpecker's selection of foraging habitat at fine and coarse spatial scales. Fine-scale data included characteristics of the foraging tree (tree level) and local habitat surrounding foraging trees (plot level, 0.04 ha), whereas coarse-scale data (224-778 ha) included patch characteristics within home ranges. Model selection by Akaike's information criterion identified a multi-scale model containing tree- and plot-level covariates, and their interaction, as the best model to characterize foraging trees. The positive effect of interaction between foraging-tree diameter and plot-level tree density suggested that foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers select both patches with dense trees and larger-diameter trees. Fire severity was not important, possibly because of the time since fire and the birds' habit of foraging on recently dead trees in adjacent unburned forests. Salvage logging that retains large-diameter trees in clumped distributions is most likely to provide long-term foraging habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers in dry coniferous forests of the interior western U.S. Following wildfire, conservation of forest patches containing weakened trees may extend the suitability of habitat for foraging Black-backed Woodpeckers by up to 8 years.

Forest Ecology and Management		2012	MAY 1 2012	271		124-131	124	131	English						Fire is being used increasingly as a forest management tool throughout North America, but its effects on reptiles and amphibians in many ecosystems are unclear. Open woodlands with understories dominated by herbaceous vegetation benefit many wildlife species, but maintaining these woodlands requires frequent burning. Although many studies have compared herpetofaunal responses in burned forests to unburned forests, fewer studies have examined changes in the herpetofaunal community during the interval between short-rotation prescribed burns. We examined changes in habitat and relative abundance of reptiles and amphibians each year within a 3-year burn cycle in nine restored pine woodlands of western Arkansas, USA. Overall numbers of reptiles did not change among the three burn years; however, capture rates for one snake species (southern black racer [Coluber constrictor priapus]) and three lizards differed among the three post-burn years. Overall capture rate for anurans and all amphibians combined was greatest the first year after burning, mostly because captures of dwarf American toads (Bufo americanus charlessmithi) were substantially greater in stands the first year after burning. Salamander captures were infrequent. Capture rates of most reptile and amphibian species declined over the 3-year sampling period. Only minor changes in capture rate occurred among the 36 species we evaluated during the intervening years between frequent burns. Capture rates for only two species were lower the first year after fire. Although not all herpetofaunal species benefited from frequent fire, most species appeared to tolerate the frequent burning necessary for maintaining open pine woodlands in the Ouachita Mountains.

On Goias State it has been found on different sites even though the low potential to its vegetation occurrence. Thus, we do an environmental diagnosis on C. obrieni incidence sites, identifying soil cover and major land uses, fragments with potential to support its ecological requirements and the main threats to its conservation. Results demonstrate that the soil cover and use matrix on Porangatu and Novo Planalto quadrants are dominated by agro pasturelands. On Minacu 1 and Minacu 3, the native vegetation area is a little higher than human modified areas, while on Minacu 2 different Cerrado physiognomies predominate on the landscape. Average size of potential fragments on Novo Planalto and Porangatu were significantly lower than Minacu fragments, predominating vegetation fragments smaller than 10 ha in all quadrants analyzed. Main threats to C. obrieni are associated to deforestation and fire, generated chiefly by agriculture and pasture expansion over native vegetation.

However, the influence of habitat variables on the reproductive success of woodpeckers has received less attention than it has in other avian taxonomic groups. We estimated nest-survival rates for the White-headed Woodpecker (Picoides albolarvatus), Hairy Woodpecker (P. villosus), and Northern Flicker (Colaptes auratus) in managed ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests along the eastern slope of the Cascade Range in Washington, 2005-2010. Using a model-selection framework, we found that the most supported models included terms for a quadratic effect of date and habitat type for the Hairy Woodpecker, a negative effect of percent shrub cover for the White-headed Woodpecker, and a negative linear effect of date and habitat type, a negative linear effect of snag density, and a positive linear effect of tree density for the flicker. Survival rates over the entire cycle (laying + incubation + nestling stages) were 0.51 in unburned stands and 0.41 in burned stands for the Hairy Woodpecker, 0.70 for the White-headed Woodpecker, and 0.41 in unburned stands and 0.80 in burned stands for the flicker. In both habitats of our study survival rates of Hairy Woodpecker nests are lower than those reported in other studies, while those of White-headed Woodpecker nests are comparable to those reported in other areas of that species' range.

Effects of post-fire salvage logging on cavity-nesting birds and small mammals in southeastern Montana. Canadian Field-Naturalist 125(4): 316-326. We investigated how post-fire salvage logging of Ponderosa Pine (Pinus ponderosa) affected populations of cavity-nesting birds and small mammals in southeastern Montana in 2004 and 2005. We examined two salvage and two control plots with three point-count stations and one small mammal trap site randomly distributed across each plot. We used point counts and distance sampling methods to estimate density of cavity-nesting birds on each treatment. We also searched each plot for nests and used program MARK to construct a set of candidate models to investigate variations in nest survival related to treatment, year. and time. We used live traps arranged in webs centered on trapping sites and distance sampling methods to estimate small mammal density. Habitat characteristics were also quantified on each plot. Density of all cavity-nesting birds combined and of Hairy Woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in particular were higher on the control than the salvage treatment. Density of large trees and abundance of active cavities were higher on the control treatment. Nest cavities on the salvage treatment were most often located in non-logged watersheds. Nest survival estimates were uniformly high, with only marginal variations attributed to treatment and year. Density of Deer Mice (Peromyscus maniculatus) was higher on the salvage than the control treatment, reflecting the amount of downed woody debris created during harvest.

Wildlife Monographs		2011	JUL 2011		177	1-38	1	38	English						Military lands are a valuable resource in recovery of threatened, endangered, and at-risk species worldwide and have the highest density of threatened and endangered species of all major land management agencies in the United States. Many red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) that reside on federal lands occur on 15 military installations in the southeastern United States. This close association has increased concern over potential conflicts between conservation requirements of endangered species and the military's mission of combat readiness. Our objectives were to 1) determine if military training operations affect behavior, reproductive success, and productivity of red-cockaded woodpeckers; 2) develop a frequency-weighting function to assess woodpecker hearing sensitivity; 3) identify factors that affect woodpecker responses to military training operations; 4) develop distance and dose-response thresholds for quantifying woodpecker responses to noise levels and stimulus distances; 5) characterize military training operations through quantification of sound levels, source identification, distance from active woodpecker nests, frequency spectra, duration, and frequency of occurrence; and 6) document baseline woodpecker nesting behavior. We conducted our study on the Fort Stewart Military Installation located in southeast Georgia, USA. Downy woodpeckers, as surrogates for red-cockaded woodpeckers, had their best hearing sensitivity within the peak range of the power spectrum of both downy and red-cockaded woodpecker vocalizations, which is at a higher frequency than that of a typical passerine. Overall, woodpeckers had a reduced auditory sensitivity relative to human hearing sensitivity and other species of small birds, especially in the frequency range >4 kHz. Woodpeckers were most sensitive in the 1.5- to 4.0-kHz range. Sensitivity appeared to drop off quickly at frequencies <1.0 kHz and >4.0 kHz. Overall, we did not find that the woodpecker-frequency-weighting function we developed provided a better predictor of woodpecker flush response compared with A-weighting. More research is needed to better understand the relationship between frequency-weighting functions and woodpecker response behavior. Potential breeding groups of woodpeckers across the population increased from 158 in 1997 to 181 in 2000, wheras nesting groups increased from 141 in 1998 to 170 in 2000, for overall increases of 14.6% and 20.6%, respectively, over the 3 years of this project. Fledging success rates for individual nests within the overall population remained consistent from 1998 to 2000, averaging 84.4%. Mean clutch sizes for woodpecker groups for 1998 to 2000 ranged from 2.75 to 3.01 eggs/nest, brood size ranged from 2.01 to 2.22 nestlings/nest, whereas the average number of young fledged ranged from 1.57 to 1.76 young/occupied nest. We observed no difference in reproductive success or productivity between experimental and control-tested red-cockaded woodpecker groups. Overall, experimental test groups produced an average of 2.98 eggs/nest, 1.89 nestlings/nest, and 1.54 young/occupied nest from 1999 to 2000, compared with 2.73 eggs/nest, 1.91 nestlings/nest, and 1.57 young/occupied nest at control groups. We measured behavioral responses (nest attendance and arrivals and departures from the nest) of red-cockaded woodpeckers to military training events through direct and indirect (i.e., video surveillance) observation of 464.5 hours of woodpecker nesting behavior before and after controlled experimental events while recording and characterizing militry-generated sound events using sound-recording equipment. We presented woodpeckers with actual 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators from controlled distances to develop distance and sound thresholds. We used video surveillance to document potential behavioral responses of woodpeckers primarily during nonexperimental military training operations in areas that could not be safely monitored and to determine baseline woodpecker nesting behaviors. We recorded 2,846 nonexperimental military noise events in 157 data sessions at 50 red-cockaded woodpecker groups from 1998 to 2000. We also recorded 206 experimental tests at 58 woodpecker groups during 1999 and 2000. Life-table analyses of flush response time showed that at short ranges (15-30 m) the flush response was stronger for artillery simulator blasts than for blank fire in both the incubation and the nestling phases. In contrast, at medium distances (45-60 m) blank fire tended to produce more flush responses than artillery fire in both incubation and nestling phases. At longer distances (>60 m), blank fire and artillery produced similar flush responses in the incubation phase, whereas flush response was stronger for blank fire than for artillery in the nestling phase. In general, most animals that responded to military activity flushed within 5 seconds of the stimulus event. Woodpeckers returned to nests within an average of 4.4 minutes after being flushed by artillery simulators and 6.3 minutes after 0.50-caliber blank-fire tests. Woodpecker flush response rates increased as stimulus distance decreased and sound levels increased, regardless of stimulus type or year. Woodpeckers did not flush from nests when 0.50-caliber blank machine gun fire and artillery simulators were >152 m away and sound-exposure levels (decibels [dB]) were <68 dBW (woodpecker-based frequency-weighting curve) and <65 dBW, respectively. We found that blast treatments reduced arrival rates of adults at the nest, with the amount of reduction dependent on the type of blast stimulus and number of helpers at the nest. On the other hand, blast treatments had no detectable effects on nest attendance. The effect of blank fire on incubation-phase arrivals over a 30-minute interval (about 40% reduction) was nearly twice that of artillery simulator fire (about a 20% reduction). There was no evidence supporting any effect of stimulus type on arrivals during the nestling phase. Blast stimuli during incubation reduced arrivals by 40% when no helpers were present, but the strength of this effect decreased to 28% when one helper was present, and was only 6% for nests with >= 2 helpers. Distance of the blast from the nest did not affect the response of arrival rates to blast treatments. Infrequent, short-duration military training exercises, as measured, did not appear to substantially impact red-cockaded woodpecker reproductive success and productivity on the Fort Stewart Military Installation. Our results may be applicable to other military installations where similar training activities and intensity levels occur. Additional research is needed to address possible habituation or sensitization of red-cockaded woodpeckers to human activities in proximity to active nest sites.Although we attempted to monitor woodpecker response to a number of military training activities, other types of military training operations or human-based activities with louder noise, longer duration, incrased human presence, and greater frequency of occurrence could more negatively influence woodpecker nesting behavior and need to be investigated. Our results do not support the hypothesis that military maneuver training operations are limiting factors in the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers on military installations, based on our level and type of testing. Natural resource management policies on military installations have had a positive influence on the recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers and probably outweigh the negative effects of typical military training.

Wilson Journal of Ornithology		2011	JUN 2011	123	2	381-386	381	386	English						A stand-replacing fire in 404 ha of jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and mixed pine forest in Michigan's Upper Peninsula in 2007 resulted in Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) nesting at high density in 2008, the second possible nesting season post-fire. Nests were found within a 93-ha study area and a 19-ha stand (a subset of the 93-ha study area) in 199.5 survey hours concentrated in March July. The 19-ha stand had six nests, a density of 0.31 nests/ha or 0.63 individuals/ha, while the 93-ha study area had 20 nests yielding 0.21 nests/ha or 0.42 individuals/ha. These nest densities are higher than previously reported in the literature for comparable stands, indicating a large influx of nesting woodpeckers post-fire. High nesting densities in this study may have resulted from: (1) optimal timing of the fire for wood-boring beetle exploitation of burned trees, (2) the discrete nature of burned habitat in the study due to impacts of salvage logging, or (3) our focus on regions of the burn where high nesting densities occurred, as the entire burned area (404 ha) was not included in nest density calculations.

Yet, post-fire conditions may vary greatly within and among burns and thereby may affect habitat suitability for these species. We studied habitat selection of nesting black-backed woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus Swainson) in recently burned spruce-dominated boreal forests. Our objectives were to (i) identify factors involved in snag selection for both nesting and foraging and (ii) examine selection of nest sites within the burned landscape. A total of 92 nests and 1612 foraging observations were used to investigate snag selection. Our results show that both pre-fire forest conditions and fire severity are important in determining the quality of burned forests for black-backed woodpeckers. This species selected large snags for both nesting (>20 cm DBH) and foraging (>15 cm DBH). Woodpeckers selected deciduous and degraded "pre-fire" snags for nesting whereas black spruce snags that had been created by fire and that were moderately burned were preferred for foraging. Nest sites were concentrated in burned mature stands and supported higher densities of large snags (e. g., >15 cm DBH). Our results suggest that burned forest patches of at least 20 ha and composed mainly of burned mature and old-growth forests should be maintained during post-fire harvesting. The decrease in the amount of late seral stands in managed forest landscapes raises concerns about the future availability of high-quality burned forests for this species.

Journal of Wildlife Management		2011	MAY 2011	75	4	794-804	794	804	English						Salvage logging practices in recently burned forests often have direct effects on species associated with dead trees, particularly cavity-nesting birds. As such, evaluation of postfire management practices on nest survival rates of cavity nesters is necessary for determining conservation strategies. We monitored 1,797 nests of 6 cavity-nesting bird species: Lewis's woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis), hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), black-backed woodpecker (P. arcticus), northern flicker (Colaptes auratus), western bluebird (Sialia mexicana), and mountain bluebird (S. currucoides) from 1994 to 2004 in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), mixed-severity burned forests (partially logged and unlogged) of Idaho, USA. Based on a priori hypotheses, we modeled daily survival rate (DSR) of nests as a function of abiotic (temperature, precipitation), temporal (time since fire, calendar year) and biotic factors (distance to unburned forest, nest height, and tree harvest [partial-salvage logging vs. unlogged]). Multiple abiotic and biotic factors, other than direct effects of salvage logging, affected daily survival rates of breeding cavity-nesting birds. Hairy woodpecker was the only species in which partial-salvage logging had a measurable, negative impact on DSR. Managers implementing carefully planned salvage logging prescriptions that include both unlogged reserves and partially logged areas can expect to maintain habitat for successfully breeding cavity-nesting birds of the interior northwestern United States. Our results also suggest that nest survival for some species of cavity-nesting birds could be improved if unlogged reserves are located centrally in postfire forests, distant from unburned habitats that potentially serve as sources of nest predators.

(jsaracco@birdpop.org) ; Siegel, Rodney B.; Wilkerson, Robert L.									Ecosphere		2011	MAR 2011	2	3				English						The Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) has been designated by the USDA Forest Service as a management indicator species for snags in burned conifer forests of the Sierra Nevada of California, USA. However, little is known about the characteristics that affect between-fire and within-fire habitat selection by the species in the region. Here we report on the first broad-scale survey of Black-backed Woodpeckers on wildfire-affected forests of the Sierra Nevada. We implemented a Bayesian hierarchical model to: 1) estimate Black-backed Woodpecker occupancy probability in fire areas burned within a time window of 1-10 years; 2) identify relationships between occupancy probability and habitat covariates (fire age, change in canopy cover pre-to-post fire, and snag basal area), elevation, and latitude; and 3) estimate detection probability and relate it to survey interval length and survey type (passive v. broadcast). We included random fire-area effects in our model of occupancy probability to accommodate clusters of non-independent points surveyed within the larger set of fire areas. Mean occupancy probability was estimated to be 0.097. Elevation (after controlling for latitude) had the strongest effect on occupancy probability (higher occupancy at higher elevation) followed by latitude (higher occupancy at northerly sites). Fire age was also important; occupancy probability was about 4X higher on the youngest compared to oldest fires. Although the direction of regression coefficients were in the expected direction (positive), snag basal area and canopy cover change were of minor importance in affecting occupancy probability. There was some indication, however, that the importance of snag basal area increased with fire age. Weak links between occupancy and canopy cover change suggested the species uses a range of burn severities, and such heterogeneity may promote habitat longevity. Our estimate of overall detection probability (across all survey intervals) was 0.772. We found strong effects of survey interval length (higher for longer interval) and, especially survey type (higher for broadcast survey) on detection probability. Our modeling framework and implementation illustrates the flexibility of the Bayesian hierarchical approach for handling complexities such as estimating derived parameters (and variances) and modeling random effects, and should prove generally useful for occupancy studies.

Condor		2011	FEB 2011	113	1	183-193	183	193	English						Riparian woodlands of aspen (Populus tremuloides) provide valuable breeding habitat for several cavity-nesting birds. Although anecdotal information for this habitat is available for Lewis's Woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis), no study has previously examined the importance of aspen woodlands to this species' breeding biology. From 2002 to 2004, we monitored 76 Lewis's Woodpecker nests in aspen riparian woodlands of south-central Idaho to describe nest-site characteristics and estimate the nests' survival. We quantified the vegetation at nest sites and randomly selected other sites to determine habitat features important in the species' selection of a nest site. We then related these features, as well as several time-specific covariates, to nest survival. Lewis's Woodpecker selected nest trees that were larger in diameter than random trees and selected nest sites with more trees, fewer woody stems, and less bare ground than random sites. However, nest-site characteristics were not important determinants of nest survival. Rather, nest-initiation date and daily maximum temperature had the strongest influence on nest survival, which was higher for early nesters and increased with increasing daily maximum temperature. Nest survival (74%) and productivity (2.3 fledglings per successful nest) were comparable to values observed for Lewis's Woodpeckers in burned pine forests, suggesting that aspen riparian woodlands also serve as valuable breeding habitat for this species in the Intermountain West.

In 2001, an important decision was made to be part of a scientific society with close contacts to universities, and to appoint a professor in conservation biology as the scientific leader. Together with the universities, new programmes were developed where traditional academic knowledge could be combined with the experience and practical hands-on knowledge of the zoo world. Components of these programmes are held at Nordens Ark on a contracted basis. Nordens Ark has developed international research schools together with Gothenburg University, and conservation aspects of threatened wild animal species and domestic breeds provide the overarching theme. Nordens Ark has successfully taken part in breeding and reintroduction programmes for, among others, the White-backed woodpecker Dendrocopos leucotos, the Peregrine falcon Falco peregrinus, the Lesser white-fronted goose Anser erythropus, the Green toad Bufo viridis and the Fire-bellied toad Bombina bombina. Nordens Ark has also been contracted by national and international conservation authorities or organizations to ensure that the best possible conservation measures are taken when conflicts arise between infrastructure projects and the conservation of threatened species.

The result was a major change in the landscape from harvesting and prescribed burns in addition to the wide scale application of a systemic insecticide known as monosodium methanearsonate (MSMA). Since MSMA contains arsenic, is highly stable, and was being applied in increasingly large quantities, our study evaluated the potential impacts to forest birds, particularly woodpeckers. From 2002 to 2006, we investigated the exposure of breeding woodpeckers to MSMA ingested via contaminated bark beetles. We measured high levels of arsenic in beetles from treated trees, and found that significant amounts of debarking on many MSMA-treated trees indicating woodpeckers were feeding on them. Radio-telemetry confirmed that woodpeckers breeding near MSMA treatments regularly used those stands. Blood samples of woodpeckers and other forest birds revealed elevated arsenic concentrations. Through a concurrent laboratory dosing study of Zebra finches (Taeniopygia guttata), we estimated that woodpeckers were receiving enough MSMA through ingestion of contaminated beetles to cause poorer growth and mortality of young birds and mass loss in adults. We concluded that the combination of extensive harvesting in the region in combination with the large numbers of treated MSMA trees was potentially detrimental to forest bird populations. By the end of our study, MSMA approval for use in Canada was revoked and the Ministry of Forests did not pursue re-registration of MSMA. We clearly demonstrated that large-scale MSMA use had the potential to cause serious harm to forest birds, while appearing to have limited efficacy in beetle control. This was a landmark study in the field of wildlife ecotoxicology a first to evaluate the exposure and effects of a toxic chemical to woodpeckers in forest ecosystems.

Wilson Journal of Ornithology		2010	SEP 2010	122	3	518-531	518	531	English						We investigated how variation in fire severity (control or no fire; low, medium, and high severity fires) and interval (1-2 years vs. 3-6 years after fires) affected habitat and avian abundance, species diversity, richness, and evenness in the southern Appalachian Mountains. Fire severity and interval had significant implications for both habitat and avian communities. Species richness within 2 years of fires was on average 26% higher in areas receiving medium and high severity treatments than in unburned control units. Species diversity and species richness were markedly greater 3-6 years after fires within high severity treatments (12 and 44%, respectively), compared to unburned controls. Relative abundance and species evenness did not vary with fire severity or time since tire. The short-term effects of low severity fires, or high severity fires with short rotation periods (<= 2 years) may have limited positive effects on avian communities. Facilitation of disturbance regimes including mid to high severity fires, which foster uneven-aged forests, can be an effective conservation tool for restoring avian communities.

We used Mahalanobis distance methods to develop predictive models of white-headed woodpecker (Picoides albolarvatus) nesting habitat in postfire ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa)-dominated landscapes on the Fremont-Winema National Forests in south central Oregon, USA. The 1-km radius (314 ha) surrounding 45 nest sites was open-canopied before fire and a mosaic of burn severities after wildfire. The 1-ha surrounding nests of white-headed woodpeckers had fewer live trees per hectare and more decayed and larger diameter snags than at non-nest sites. The leading cause of nest failure seemed to be predation. Habitat and abiotic features were not associated with nest survival. High daily survival rates and little variation within habitat features among nest locations suggest white-headed woodpeckers were consistently selecting high suitability habitats. Management activities that open the forest canopy and create conditions conducive to a mosaic burn pattern will probably provide suitable white-headed woodpecker nesting habitat after wildfire. When making postfire salvage logging decisions, we suggest that retention of larger, more decayed snags will provide nesting habitat in recently burned forests.

The tree is susceptible to insect damage and is attacked by leaf eaters, termites, root grubs, sapsuckers, gall formers, stem borers, pod borers and fruit borers. The mango mealybug Drosicha mangiferae Green (Hemiptera: Monophlebidae) is one of the most destructive pests in the Indo-Pak subcontinent, sometimes causing premature fruit drop. A combination of several management strategies such as use of entomopathogens, chemical insecticides and burning of adult females has been used to control D. mangiferae. Overreliance on insecticides has eliminated natural enemies, and we were therefore interested in investigating the impact of alternative insect pest management strategies such as cultural and mechanical techniques on D. mangiferae. The results of our studies suggested that different bands significantly stopped the upward movement of overwintering and surviving populations of D. mangiferae. To augment the bands' results, mounding the tree with debris on a plastic sheet once a year was the most effective technique and resulted in maximum reduction of the nymphal population of D. mangiferae. The newly developed Haider band-designed in our laboratory in the present studies-was very successful in the field in controlling the upward movement of newly hatched nymphs on trees: only 0.8% of the nymphs crossed the band. Only 7% to 10% of the nymphs crossed plastic sheets, polyethylene sheets and funnel bands. The cotton and gunny bag (jute) bands were the least effective: 42% of the nymphs managed to cross them. The results suggested that employing cultural practices and bands together could reduce the need for insecticide treatments and offer a sustainable method for D. mangiferae control.

We tested if male and female woodpeckers exhibited the same movement patterns using both spatially implicit and explicit genetic analyses to define population structure and movement patterns of both sexes among populations. Three genetic groups were identified, a large, genetically continuous population that spans from the Rocky Mountains to Quebec, a small isolated population in South Dakota and a separate population in the western portion of their distribution (Oregon). Patterns of genetic diversity suggest extensive gene flow mediated by both males and females within the continuous boreal forest. However, male-mediated gene flow is the main form of connectivity between the continuously distributed group and the smaller populations of South Dakota and Oregon that are separated by large areas of unforested habitat, which apparently serves as a barrier to movement of female woodpeckers.

Overall avian community composition did not change among the treatments. However, individual species responses varied with the chipping sparrow showing lower density in treatments, whereas hermit thrush, mountain chickadee, white-headed woodpecker, western bluebird, American crow, and common raven increased in treatment units. Daily survival rates of nesting guilds were similar in treated versus control stands; however, burn-only showed lower daily survival rates compared with other treatments. Additional research is needed to validate this result. Cavity-nesters (mountain chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, and house wren) and foliage-nesters (chipping sparrow) used trees that were larger in diameter than available regardless of the treatment. Our results, in combination with other results from this study area, provide important implications for managers: (1) thin-burn treatments were effective at restoring habitat for several avian focal species; (2) spring burn treatments should be carefully designed to achieve desired restoration objectives; (3) large trees provide important habitat functions and are a key component for maintaining or restoring the viability of focal avian species; and (4) additional research is needed to better understand the effects of spring burning and the long-term effects of dry forest restoration treatments.

We modeled the effects of study site, treatment, treatment category, and time since treatment on the foraging encounter rate of four individual species (red-breasted nuthatch [Sitta canadensis], mountain chickadee [Poecile gambeli], hairy woodpecker [Picoides villosus], and brown creeper [Certhia americana]) and assessed the relative importance of several tree and snag characteristics in the selection of foraging trees by these same species. The foraging encounter rate of all four species responded inconsistently across both treatment categories and study sites. Substrate diameter was the strongest and most consistent characteristic positively influencing the selection of foraging habitat structures for all species across all treatment categories. Other influential variables included the presence of bark beetles for red-breasted nuthatches, hairy woodpeckers, and brown creepers in control and burn-only treatment areas and tree species for brown creepers in bum-only and thin-only treatment areas. Although this study did not detect any major negative treatment response by any species, our results suggest that there is substantial variability in the reaction of this particular bird community to fuel reduction treatments and that managers may need to evaluate the effects of these treatments on a site-by-site and species-by-species basis.

Using line transects we surveyed the bird community of a natural Pinus canariensis forest burned in the summer of 2007 on Tenerife, Canary Islands, Spain. Our goal was to identify important environmental variables and the thresholds that influenced the pattern of bird abundance at the community, foraging guild, and species-specific level. Models were constructed by means of regression trees and cross validation applying the 1-SE rule. Mixed results were observed and only 2 species were clearly affected by fire severity. Overall, total bird abundance, total species richness, and total bird diversity were positively influenced by low, very low, and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively, and the presence of either Erica or Myrica shrubs. Consequently, high canopy fire severity had an overall negative effect on bird community characteristics. Abundance of Myrica shrubs affected positively general ground foragers such as common blackbird (Turdus merula cabrerae) and Canary Islands chiffchaff (Phylloscopus canariensis), a canopy forager. The number of thin trees was important for canopy foragers such as goldcrest (Regulus regulus teneriffae) and African blue tit (Cyanistes teneriffae teneriffae), but also for a bark forager, the great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major canariensis). European robin (Erithacus rubecula superbus) and the ubiquitous endemic blue chaffinch (Fringilla teydea teydea) were influenced by low and moderate canopy fire severity, respectively. We recommend that land managers incorporate these results into future post-fire management plans. Priority post-fire actions should be directed toward the protection and conservation of the endemic blue chaffinch, a species of conservation concern on the nearby island of Gran Canaria.

International Journal of Wildland Fire		2010		19	4	500-511	500	511	English						Fire severity can vary greatly within and among burns, even in the Canadian boreal forest where fire regimes consist mostly of stand-replacing fires. We investigated the effects of fire severity on the long-term occupancy of burns by (i) saproxylic insects and (ii) three wood-foraging birds. Based on observations made 6 to 11 years after fire in burned conifer forests that varied in fire severity in Quebec, Canada, our results indicate that low-severity portions of the burns likely provided snag conditions suitable for the long-term presence of deadwood-associated insects and birds. The black-backed woodpecker, a post-fire forest specialist, was still abundant 6 and 8 years after fire. This pattern was likely explained by the persistence of several saproxylic insect species that are associated with recently dead trees and by the positive effect of lower fire severity on the abundance of Arhopalus foveicollis, a cerambycid with a long life cycle in dead wood. The American three-toed woodpecker and the brown creeper, and their associated prey (Scolytinae beetles), were more abundant in burned stands of lower v. higher severity. We conclude that less severely burned snags and stands within high-severity burns may favour the long-term presence of trophic webs that involve saproxylic insects and wood-foraging birds in burned boreal forests.

These outbreaks are managed through removal of trees infested with mountain pine beetles to control mountain pine beetle populations and salvage timber resources. To minimize impacts to black-backed woodpeckers while meeting management objectives, there is a need to identify characteristics of these areas that support black-backed woodpeckers. We examined the habitat associations of this species nesting in areas of beetle outbreaks in the Black Hills, South Dakota in 2004 and 2005. We used an information theoretic approach and discrete choice models to evaluate nest-site selection of 42 woodpecker nests at 3 spatial scales-territory, nest area, and nest tree. At the territory scale (250 m around nest), availability and distribution of food best explained black-backed woodpecker selection of beetle outbreaks versus the surrounding forest. Selection at the territory scale was positively associated with densities of trees currently infested by mountain pine beetles and indices of wood borer (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) abundance, and was greatest at distances of 50-100 m from the nearest patch of infestation. At the nest-area scale (12.5 m radius around the nest), densities of snags positively influenced nest-area selection. Finally, at the nest-tree scale, aspen (Populus tremuloides) and 3-5-year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) snags were important resources. The association between abundant wood-boring insects and black-backed woodpeckers creates a difficult challenge for forest managers. In the absence of fire, areas of beetle outbreak might serve as the only substantial source of habitat in the Black Hills. Regulating insect populations via salvage logging will reduce key food resources to black-backed woodpeckers during nesting. Therefore, given the relatively infrequent occurrence of large-scale fire in the Black Hills, management should recognize the importance of beetle-killed forests to the long-term viability of the black-backed woodpecker population in the Black Hills.

Given its high abundance in recent burns, it has been hypothesized that post-fire forests are source habitats for this species. We conducted a 3-year post-fire study to evaluate the temporal occupancy and reproductive success of black-backed woodpeckers in high-severity burned black spruce forests of central Quebec, Canada. We examined how reproductive success varied temporally and spatially within a burned landscape and investigated the potential source or sink status of this woodpecker population over time. Woodpecker nest density was high in the year after fire but declined significantly over the 3-year period. Based on 106 nests, nest success declined from 84% the first year after fire to 73% and 25%, respectively, for the second and third years after fire. Nest density and reproductive success were higher in areas with high proportions of burned mature forests than in areas dominated by burned young forests. Reproductive success was also higher in proximity to unburned forests. Comparison of annual productivity with a range of survival estimates indicated that these burned forests likely functioned as source habitats for the first 2 years following fire, although this status varied as a function of pre-fire forest age. Our results suggest that post-fire forests may contribute significantly to population levels in fire-prone ecosystems. Forest management practices that reduce the amount of mature and overmature forests can affect the quality of post-fire habitats important to the black-backed woodpecker and other fire-associated species.

Ecological Applications		2009	JUL 2009	19	5	1253-1263	1253	1263	English						Prescribed fire is a management tool used to reduce fuel loads on public lands in forested areas in the western United States. Identifying the impacts of prescribed fire on bird communities in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests is necessary for providing land management agencies with information regarding the effects of fuel reduction on sensitive, threatened, and migratory bird species Recent developments in occupancy modeling have established a framework for quantifying the impacts of management practices on wildlife community dynamics. We describe a Bayesian hierarchical model of multi-species occupancy accounting for detection probability, and we demonstrate the model's usefulness for identifying effects of habitat disturbances on wildlife communities. Advantages to using the model include the ability to estimate the effects of environmental impacts on rare or elusive species, the intuitive nature of the modeling, the incorporation of detection probability, the estimation of parameter uncertainty, the flexibility of the model to suit a variety of experimental designs, and the composite estimate of the response that applies to the collection of observed species as opposed to merely a small subset of common species. Our modeling of the impacts of prescribed fire on avian communities in a ponderosa pine forest in Washington indicate that prescribed fire treatments result in increased occupancy rates for several bark-insectivore, cavity-nesting species including a management species of interest, Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus). Three aerial insectivore species, and the ground insectivore, American Robin (Turdus migratorius), also responded positively to prescribed fire, whereas three foliage insectivores and two seed specialists, Clark's Nutcracker (Nucifraga columbiana) and the Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus), declined following treatments.

During winters of 2004-2006, we compared bird density, foraging behavior, and bark beetle activity among burned treatment and unburned control units. Hairy woodpecker density was 5 times greater in burn units, whereas white-breasted nuthatches and pygmy nuthatches had similar densities between treatments. Compared to available trees, trees used by foraging hairy woodpeckers had 9 times greater odds of having bark beetles in control units and 12 times greater odds in burn units. Tree diameter appeared to be the main factor bark-foraging birds used in selecting winter foraging trees. Our results suggest that forest managers can use prescribed fire treatments without detrimental effects to wintering nuthatches, while providing additional food to hairy woodpeckers.

To reduce the risk of uncharacteristic stand-replacing. res in the southwestern United States, land managers are implementing restoration and fuels treatments ( e. g., mechanical thinning, prescribed. re) in progressively larger stands of dry, lower elevation ponderosa pine ( Pinus ponderosa) forest. We used a Before-After/Control-Impact experimental design to quantify the multi-scale response of avifauna to large (similar to 250-400 ha) prescribed. re treatments on four sites in Arizona and New Mexico dominated by ponderosa pine. Using distance sampling and an information-theoretic approach, we estimated changes in density for 14 bird species detected before (May-June 2002-2003) and after (May-June 2004-2005) prescribed. re treatments. We observed few site-level differences in pre- and posttreatment density, and no species responded strongly to treatment on all four sites. Point-level spatial models of individual species response to treatment, habitat variables, and. re severity revealed ecological relationships that were more easily interpreted. At this scale, pretreatment forest structure and patch characteristics were important predictors of posttreatment differences in bird species density. Five species ( Pygmy Nuthatch [Sitta pygmaea], Western Bluebird [Sialia mexicana], Steller's Jay [Cyanocitta stelleri], American Robin [Turdus migratorius], and Hairy Woodpecker [Picoides villosus]) exhibited a strong treatment response, and two of these species ( American Robin and Hairy Woodpecker) could be associated with meaningful. re severity response functions. The avifaunal response patterns that we observed were not always consistent with those reported by more common studies of wildland. re events. Our results suggest that, in the short term, the distribution and abundance of common members of the breeding bird community in Southwestern ponderosa pine forests appear to be tolerant of low- to moderate-intensity prescribed. re treatments at multiple spatial scales and across multiple geographic locations.

We conducted multiple-observer surveys in burned and unburned mixed coniferous forests in Oregon to identify important factors influencing detection rates of woodpecker nests. We found 21 Black-backed Woodpecker nests and 38 Hairy Woodpecker nests in burned forest, and three Hairy Woodpecker nests in unburned forest. Competing models of detection probability in Program MARK indicated that nest-detection probability differed by nest stage. We found no evidence to indicate that detection rates of nests were associated with survey timing during the nesting season. Raw nest counts in burned coniferous forests may underestimate nest numbers, especially for nests in early stages of development. Black-backed Woodpecker nests were slightly more detectable than those of Hairy Woodpeckers in burned forests, and observers may differ in their abilities to detect nests. Received 12 February 2008.

Our objectives were to examine factors that allowed for co-existence in two burned pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests in the Black Hills, South Dakota. We monitored 53 Lewis's and 38 Red-headed Woodpecker nests between 2002 and 2005, and compared clutch initiation dates and nest-site selection. Clutch initiation dates did not differ between species for 3 of 4 years. We compared multiple habitat factors surrounding nests of the two species, and only tree and snag densities differed between Red-headed Woodpecker nest sites (65.1 +/- 5.78 stems/ha) and those of Lewis's Woodpeckers (48.5 +/- 6.06 stems/ha). These results are consistent with the foraging techniques used by the two species. We suggest that habitat partitioning is an important mechanism of coexistence for these two species, but also recommend further research on their foraging strategies. Received 3 December 2007.

(hayesj@ufl.edu)									Forest Ecology and Management		2009	FEB 10 2009	257	3	1119-1128	1119	1128	English						In coniferous forests of western North American, fire is an important disturbance that influences the structure and composition of floral and faunal communities. The impacts of postfire management, including salvage logging and replanting, on these forests are not well known. We compared densities and relative abundances of forest birds after fire in unsalvaged stands and stands subjected to one of two intensities of salvage logging (moderate, 30 snags retained per ha and heavy, 5-6 snags retained per ha) in mixed-conifer forests in central Oregon. We used analysis of variance with repeated measures to evaluate three hypotheses concerning the influence of different intensities of salvage on densities or relative abundances of sixteen species of birds, and two hypotheses concerning the influence of time since salvage logging on relative abundances or densities of birds. We also examined the relationship between vegetation and abundances of each bird species. We did not detect significant differences among treatments in densities or relative abundances for eight species and one genus of birds. We detected significant differences for seven species, though the patterns differed among species. Relative abundances or densities of the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), hairy woodpecker (P. villosus), brown creeper (Certhia americana), western wood-pewee (Contopus sordidulus) and yellow-rumped warbler (Dendroica coronata) were lower in the heavy and moderate salvage treatment compared to the unsalvaged treatment, while densities of the dark-eyed junco (Junco hyemalis) and fox sparrow (Passerella iliaca) were greater in the moderately and heavily salvaged stands than in the unsalvaged treatment. We detected significant differences between years for four species of birds. Our findings suggest that both cavity-nesting and cup-nesting species respond to salvage logging, and that some species respond uniquely to habitat features influenced by salvage logging. For species that responded negatively to salvage logging, the moderate salvage intensity did not appear to mitigate the negative influence of salvage logging. Areas of unlogged burned forest appear to provide important habitat for some species of birds following forest fires. Our findings parallel those of other recent studies of these species, suggesting robust patterns that transcend particular locations. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Specifically, such forests are said to carry higher fuel loads and experience. res that are more severe than those that occurred historically. It remains unclear, however, how far these generalizations can be extrapolated in time and space, and how well they apply to the more mesic ponderosa pine systems and to other forest systems within the western United States. I use data on the pattern of distribution of one bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) as derived from 16 465 sample locations to show that, in western Montana, this bird species is extremely specialized on severely burned forests. Such specialization has profound implications because it suggests that the severe. res we see burning in many forests in the Intermountain West are not entirely "unnatural'' or "unhealthy.'' Instead, severely burned forest conditions have probably occurred naturally across a broad range of forest types for millennia. These findings highlight the fact that severe. re provides an important ecological backdrop for. re specialists like the Black-backed Woodpecker, and that the presence and importance of severe. re may be much broader than commonly appreciated.

Although there have been several studies of postfire salvage-logging effects on bird species, there have been few studies of effects on bird species associated with high-severity patches in forests that have otherwise burned at lower severities. From 2004 to 2006, we investigated the foraging presence or absence of three woodpecker species, the Black-backed (Picoides arctictis), Hairy (P. villosus), and White-headed (P. albolarvatus) Woodpeckers, within four different forest habitat conditions in Sierra Nevada conifer forests: unburned; moderate-severity and unlogged; high-severity and unlogged; and high-severity and logged. We found Black-backed Woodpecker foraging was restricted to unlogged high-severity patches. Hairy Woodpeckers foraged most in unlogged high-severity patches, and White-headed Woodpeckers showed no significant difference in presence among conditions. These results suggest that unlogged, high-severity forest is important habitat for the Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers.

However, most research has focused on avian use of cavities in the breeding season, with little attention given to other cavity using guilds or cavity use during the non-breeding season. Furthermore, most breeding season studies were in unburned forests containing a mix of conifer and deciduous trees with Much less attention given to cavity rich post-burn habitats. The objective of this study was to examine cavity use during the breeding and non-breeding seasons in old-burned ponderosa pine forests in the Black Hills, South Dakota. One hundred seventy nine active cavity nests of nine cavity nesting species were monitored between 2002-2005. We examined the contents of each cavity during the breeding season and twice during each non-breeding season (fall, winter, spring) each year. Additionally, we conducted vegetative surveys to determine the microhabitat variables that might influence the occupancy of cavities in the breeding season. Binomial logistic regression with AIC model selection criteria were used to model breeding season cavity reuse for the three most common cavity excavator species, Lewis's Woodpeckers (Melanerpes lewis), Red-headed Woodpeckers (M. erythrocephalus) and Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus). All three species reused old cavities most recently used by conspecifics for breeding; snag density (dbh > 23 cm) and cavity height consistently influenced reuse of cavities for all three species. In the non-breeding season the cavities of these same three species were all commonly used, but Northern Flicker cavities contained the greatest diversity of secondary cavity users.

In the Black Hills, South Dakota, standing dead forests resulting from mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks offer food resources for Black-backed Woodpeckers, in addition to providing habitat similar to burned forest. However, data on reproductive rates in these habitats are lacking. We estimated nest success and evaluated factors affecting nest survival of Black-backed Woodpeckers in beetle-killed forests in the Black Hills in 2004 and 2005. Nest success was 78% (n = 12) in 2004 and 44% (n = 31) in 2005. Fledging rates per pair were 2.0 +/- 0.3 SE (n = 12) and 1.4 +/- 0.3 SE (n = 28) in 2004 and 2005, respectively. Our results showed that temporal effects (e.g., age, date, and year) had the greatest influence on nest survival. Nest age was the most important predictor of daily nest survival; survival was higher in older nests. Nest survival was also lower later in the breeding season. The difference in nest success between the two years requires further study; however, nest success of Black-backed Woodpeckers in beetle-killed forests in the Black Hills was within the range of nest success within postfire habitats in this area. In the Black Hills, forests experiencing beetle outbreaks offer available habitat for Black-backed Woodpeckers.

Journal of Wildlife Management		2008	AUG 2008	72	6	1361-1368	1361	1368	English						Northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) populations have experienced severe declines for several decades, and declines have been particularly precipitous in the southern United States. These declines are partially attributable to large-scale conversions of potential habitat to short-rotation pine (Pinus spp.) forests managed for wood fiber production and fire exclusion in pine-dominated landscapes. We used standard arthropod sampling techniques, human-imprinted bobwhite chicks, and vegetation response to evaluate effects of different understory vegetation management practices on brood habitat quality within a commercially managed pine forest in Louisiana, USA, during 2002-2005. Specifically, we evaluated effects of mowing, prescribed fire during the growing season, prescribed fire in combination with imazapyr application, and no vegetation management on arthropod abundance and diversity, vegetation response, and the probability of bobwhite chicks successfully capturing an arthropod. Bobwhite chicks were more successful at capturing arthropods, and arthropod abundance and diversity were greatest, in plant communities managed using prescribed fire and imazapyr. Forest stands managed using a combination of fire and imazapyr were managed primarily to benefit the federally endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis; RCW). Our findings suggest that management directed toward improving forest condition for RCWs improves habitat quality for. brooding bobwhites. However, bobwhite chicks in our study area were less successful at capturing arthropods than were chicks in other studies in the southeastern United States. Brood-earing habitat in pine forests similar to those we studied may be of generally poor quality, and could be related to precipitous declines of bobwhites in the West Gulf Coastal Plain. Managers should recognize that creating high-quality brood habitat in forests similar to those we studied will require more intensive management of understory vegetation than we studied.

Our methods focus on optimizing the sampling effort by choosing an appropriate sampling method and transect length for specific forest conditions and objectives. Sampling methods include the line-intersect method and the strip-plot method. Which method is better depends on the variable of interest, log quantities, desired precision, and forest conditions. Two statistical options are available. The first requires sampling until a desired precision level is obtained. The second is used to evaluate or monitor areas that have low log abundance compared to values in a land management plan. A minimum of 60 samples usually are sufficient to test for a significant difference between the estimated and targeted parameters. Both sampling methods are compatible with existing snag and large tree sampling methods, thereby improving efficiency by enabling the simultaneous collection of all three components-snags, large trees, and logs-to evaluate wildlife or other resource conditions of interest.Analysis of log data requires SnagPRO, a user-friendly software application designed for use with our sampling protocols. Default transect lengths are suggested for both English and metric measurement systems, but users may override default values for transect lengths that better meet their specific sampling designs. SnagPRO also analyzes wildlife snag and large tree data.					0	0		45	0	0			Environmental Sciences & Ecology	0887-4840				Terrestrial Ecology (Ecology, Environmental Sciences)	07502, Ecology: environmental biology - General and methods; 07508, Ecology: environmental biology - Animal	Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Canidae [85765]; [Canis latrans; coyote]/Rodentia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Rodents, Vertebrates; Castoridae [86295]; [Castor canadensis; beaver]/Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Felidae [85770]; [Felis rufus; bobcat] [Lynx canadensis; lynx] [Felis concolor; cougar]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Galliformes [85536]; [Dendragapus canadensis; spruce grouse]/Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Mustelidae [85780]; [Mustela vison; mink] [Martes pennanti] [Martes americana] [Lutra canadensis; otter]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Piciformes [85552]; [Picoides] [Dryocopus pileatus; woodpecker]/Rodentia, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Rodents, Vertebrates; Sciuridae [86405]; [Sciurus; squirrel]/Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Strigiformes [85564]; [Strix nebulosa; gray owl]/Carnivora, Mammalia, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Carnivores, Chordates, Mammals, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Nonhuman Mammals, Vertebrates; Ursidae [85790]; [Ursus americanus; black bear]									forest ecosystem, fire behavior, down woody material				2018-10-22	J	BCI:BCI200800475967		Article		Short-term effects of fire and fire surrogate treatments on foraging tree selection by cavity-nesting birds in dry forests of central Washington		Lyons, Andrea L.

Forest Ecology and Management		2008	MAY 15 2008	255	8-9	3203-3211	3203	3211	English						Dry forests of Washington are becoming increasingly susceptible to broadscale stand replacement fire and insect and disease epidemics. In response, land managers implement fuel reduction strategies. These situations could potentially affect numerous wildlife species, including cavity-nesting birds. Much information exists on nesting requirements of cavity-nesters, while little information is available on their foraging requirements, or how changes to their habitat affect foraging. We examined short-term responses of cavity-nesting birds in dry conifer forests of Washington, to fuel reduction treatments in 2004 and 2005, as part of the National Fire-Fire Surrogate Project (FFS). Our objective was to determine if altering the forest stand through mechanical thinning or prescribed burning or a combination of the two would alter foraging tree selection. We used linear logistic regression and Akaike's Information Criteria (AIC) to model foraging tree selection and to analyze the effects of treatments on foraging tree selection. Model averaged parameter estimates suggested that cavity-nesting birds selected for large diameter trees and FFS treatments had a positive impact on foraging for nuthatches and woodpeckers. Birds were more likely to be observed foraging in treated stands and the positive relationship was strongest in stands that received a combination of thinning and burning treatments. Enhanced foraging conditions in the thin-burn treatment may have resulted from a more complete removal of small trees, while the prescribed burn was so low-intensity, it did not remove many small trees. Bird groups selected for trees at least 1.6 times as large in diameter in treated stands as compared to control stands. Our results indicate activities such as thinning and burning may best enhance foraging habitat for bark gleaning species as a whole. Our data suggests that some important treatment design considerations include the removal of small trees and the retention of large trees and snags (>40 cm dbh) that provide important foraging substrate and nesting habitat.

Each silvicultural treatment was applied to two approximately 100aha units within each of three blocks. Prescribed burning was applied to one-half of each silvicultural treatment in a split-plot design. Occupancy was estimated at eight points in each plot for 11 bird species and three foraging guilds (bark gleaners, woodpeckers, and foliage gleaners). The frequencies of species detections on the point counts were used to estimate species richness on each plot. Occupancy did not differ among treatments for any of the guilds. Four of the 11 bird species, the American robin (Turdus migratorius L., 1766), the chipping sparrow (Spizella passerina (Bechstein, 1798)), the white-breasted nuthatch (Sitta carolinensis Latham, 1790), and the western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana (A. Wilson, 1811)), showed responses to the treatments. Species richness did not differ between the silvicultural or the burn treatments. The general lack of response of the bird community to the silvicultural and burn treatments is likely a result of the relatively large size of the trees and snags retained on both silvicultural treatments, the low intensity of the prescribed burns, and the lack of a strong contrast in tree density between the silvicultural treatments.

American Midland Naturalist		2008	APR 2008	159	2	421-433	421	433	English						Birds and vegetation were surveyed in a 9 ha plot in spring 1976 in a 73 y-old jack pine (Pinus banksiana) - black spruce (Picea mariana) forest in northeastern Minnesota. A 1368 ha wildfire burned across the area that autumn. The plot was resurveyed in 1977 and periodically through 2006. Before the fire, birds with the highest importance values were Blackburnian Warbler (Dendroica fusca), Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Red-eyed Vireo (Vireo olivaceus) and Bay-breasted Warbler (D. castanea). Within 7 y following the fire, canopy tree cover decreased to near zero as fire-damaged trees died. Afterwards, the canopy began increasing, reaching 53% cover by 30 y. Shrub cover, 8% before the fire, peaked at over 70% two decades after fire, primarily as a result of dense jack pine and black spruce regeneration, and then decreased to 58% 30 y after fire. The total number of bird species using the area doubled the first year following the fire while the number of bird species with discernable territories decreased 40%. Thereafter, territorial species began increasing and 30 y after the fire the number exceeded the pre-fire richness by 60%. Overall, density of bird territories decreased nearly three-fold the first 3 y after the fire, but by year 30, was over 56% greater than in the pre-burn mature pine forest. Loss of canopy was related to a reduction in warbler and vireo diversity while increases in woody debris and near-ground vegetation were related to an increase in ground-brush foragers such as White-throated Sparrow (Zonotrichia albicollis) and Chipping Sparrow (Spizella passerina). Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) populations increased briefly as trees died, and for five years following fire there was an increase in woodpeckers and secondary cavity nesting species. At 7 to 10 y after fire, White-throated Sparrow, Magnolia Warbler (Dendroica magnolia), Chestnut-sided Warbler (D. pensylvanica), Nashville Warbler (Vermivora ruficapilla) and Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia) dominated. White-throated Sparrow continued to be the most important bird species through the first two decades, followed by Magnolia Warbler and Red-eyed Vireo. Thirty years after fire, the dominant birds were Nashville Warbler and Ovenbird, followed distantly by Veery (Catharus fuscescens) Swainson's Thrush (Catharus ustulatus), Least Flycatcher (Empidonax minimus) and Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia). Overall, bird species using the area after 30 y remained over 70% higher than in the mature forest before the fire.

Our objectives were to examine nesting densities, reproductive parameters, and species-specific habitat selection of woodpeckers in a recently burned region of the Black Hills in South Dakota, USA, between 2001 and 2004. Postfire nesting densities were greatest in areas dominated by high prefire canopy cover, and reproductive success averaged >70%. For some species of woodpeckers, factors such as diameter at breast height, burn severity, and distance to unburned patches were important for nest-site selection. Our data indicated that nesting densities of many woodpeckers in the Black Hills were lower than what has been recorded elsewhere following recent, large wildfires in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests. Management activities that simulate mixed-severity fire effects and retain higher numbers of large snags are likely to benefit cavity nesters in this region.

The massive expansion of this natural disturbance agent is a result of both natural and human-associated influences Including milder winter weather and fire Suppression policy. Resource managers are grappling with a response to the infestation that considers economic, social, and ecological factors. In British Columbia the response has moved from a control or sanitation phase, to an economic recovery or salvage phase. The condition of the landscape resulting from the insect and the management associated with each phase will impact wildlife populations. Distribution and abundance of certain species will either increase or decline in response to changes in the forest vegetation and hydrologic regime. Caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), fisher (Martes pennanti), marten (Martes americana), woodpeckers, and pygmy nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea) are considered species with high sensitivity to mortality of pine trees that will adversely affect their forage, cover, and nesting/denning habitat.

Restoration treatments were designed to create stand structure and composition similar to pre-settlement forests, which were influenced by a frequent fire regime. Overall, avian community composition was changed as a result of the treatments. Cassin's Finch, Chipping Sparrow, and Yellow-rumped Warbler were found at higher densities in treated stands, whereas Mountain Chickadee, Western Tanager, and Red-breasted Nuthatch had higher densities in untreated stands. White-headed Woodpecker and Western Bluebird were only detected in the treated stands. Brown-headed Cowbird showed no response to treatments. We detected changes in the density of four of five foraging guilds in response to restoration treatments. Tree seedeaters, low understory and ground insectivores, and aerial insectivores all increased in density in treated stands. Overall, bark insectivores showed no density response to treatments. Tree foliage insectivore density was lower in treated than in untreated stands. Overall avian density, density of neotropical migrants, and density of some focal species were higher in treated stands. Monitoring should be continued to understand the longer-term (5-10 year) responses of land birds and to guide future forest restoration efforts.

Journal of Wildlife Management		2007	NOV 2007	71	8	2600-2611	2600	2611	English						Models of habitat suitability in postfire landscapes are needed by land managers to make timely decisions regarding postfire timber harvest and other management activities. Many species of cavity-nesting birds are dependent on postfire landscapes for breeding and other aspects of their life history and are responsive to postfire management activities (e.g., timber harvest). In addition, several cavity nesters are designated as species at risk. We compare the ability of 2 types of models to distinguish between nest and non-nest locations of 6 cavity-nesting bird species (Lewis's woodpecker [Melanerpes lewis], black-backed woodpecker [Picoides arcticus], hairy woodpecker [P. villosus], northern flicker [Colaptes auratus], western bluebird [Sialia mexicana], and mountain bluebird [S. currucoides]) in the early postfire years for a ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forest in Idaho, USA. The 2 model sets consisted of 1) models based on readily available remotely sensed data and 2) models containing field-collected data in addition to remotely sensed data (combination models). We evaluated models of nesting habitat by quantifying the model's ability to correctly identify nest and non-nest locations and by determining the percentage of correctly identified nest locations. Additionally, we developed relative habitat-suitability maps for nesting habitat of black-backed and Lewis's woodpeckers from the best models. For all species except Lewis's woodpeckers, model performance improved with the addition of field-collected data. Models containing remotely sensed data adequately distinguished between nest and non-nest locations for black-backed woodpecker and Lewis's woodpecker only, whereas models containing both field-collected and remotely sensed data were adequate for all 6 species. Improvements in the availability of more accurate remote sensing technology would likely lead to improvements in the ability of the models to predict nesting locations. External validation with data from other wildfires is necessary to confirm the general applicability of our habitat-suitability models to other forests. Land managers responsible for maintaining habitat for cavity-nesting birds in postfire landscapes can use these models to identify potential nesting areas for these species and select areas in burned forests where postfire salvage logging is most likely to have minimal impacts on cavity-nesting bird habitats.

Red-headed Woodpeckers nested more often and usurped a greater proportion of host species in logged (n = 6) than non-logged (n = 3) areas, despite host cavities being more abundant on the non-logged treatment. Usurping Red-headed Woodpecker pairs initiated nesting earlier ((x) over bar = 12 May +/- 2 days) than pairs that excavated cavities (18 May 1 2 days) which implies an existing benefit to offset the cost of interspecific conflict.

Auk		2007	JUL 2007	124	3	969-985	969	985	English						Oak savannas and woodlands historically covered millions of hectares in the midwestern United States but are rare today. We evaluated the ecological distinctiveness and conservation value of savannas and woodlands by examining bird distributions across a fire-maintained woody-vegetation gradient in northwest Indiana encompassing five habitats-open habitats with low canopy cover, savannas, woodlands, scrublands, and forests-during migration, breeding, and overwintering. Savannas and woodlands were significantly different in overall bird species composition from open and forest habitats but were often intermediate between open and forest in guild densities. Few bird species were consistently and highly concentrated in savannas or woodlands, and the Red-headed Woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus) was the only species significantly more abundant in savannas and woodlands than in open, scrub, and forest habitats. Fire frequency over a 15-year interval was a significant predictor of bird community composition and was positively related to species diversity, spring transient migrant density, and density of the most threatened species. Each habitat type had characteristics potentially important for avian conservation. Scrub had the highest density of transient migrants, which suggests it plays an important role as migration stopover habitat. More species were significantly concentrated in open or forest habitats than in the other habitats. Lack of species concentration and intermediate community composition suggested that birds experienced savannas and woodlands more as ecotones than as habitats distinct from forests or grasslands. However, this intermediate character can benefit conservation, as evidenced by savannas and woodlands having the highest density of the most threatened species along this woody-vegetation gradient.

In Spain, Pyrenean oak (Quercus pyrenaica) forests are mainly subjected to three sylvopastoral management systems which determine variations in the forest structure: (i) "young forests" subjected to frequent disturbance by fires and clear-cuttings; (ii) "Pyrenean oak dehesas", subjected to a traditional sylvopastoral system exclusive to Spain which favours the development of both old oaks and pasture; (iii) largely undisturbed "mature forests". We examined the effects of these sylvopastoral management systems on habitat use and reproduction of the middle spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos medius), a forest specialist bird, at the south-western edge of its distribution range. Habitat use was examined at multiple spatial scales. Within the territories, woodpeckers preferred large diameter oaks for foraging and decay oaks with holes for nesting. Within the forest tracts, no significant relationships between territory density and habitat structure in the forest tracts were found. At the landscape scale, dehesas and mature forests, both with high densities of important foraging and nesting trees, were occupied by woodpeckers. Young forests, with low densities of those trees, were avoided. No significant differences in territory density or reproductive success were found between dehesas and mature forests. The maintenance of viable woodpecker populations requires conservation actions at several spatial scales. Within the forest tracts, suitable densities of important foraging and nesting trees must be maintained. At the landscape scale, management decisions must consider the maintenance of traditional sylvopastoral systems in dehesas and mature forests. At the regional scale, taking into account a habitat cover in the landscape of the 7% for the Cantabrian Mountains, we estimated an area of 285,000 ha to be included in the conservation planning unit for the middle spotted woodpecker.

Forest Ecology and Management		2007	APR 30 2007	242	2-3	606-618	606	618	English						Canadian boreal forests are increasingly modified by post-fire removal of trees (salvage logging), yet the ecological consequences of this practice are little studied. As mixed-wood forests have recently become accessible for salvage operations, we studied woodpeckers in mixed-wood (trembling aspen Populus tremuloides and white spruce Picea glauca) and adjacent coniferous (black spruce Picea mariana and jack pine Pinus banksiana) areas to examine the effects of salvage logging and burn severity on these species. During 2003-2004 we carried out transect counts in 24 landscape units (625 ha each) that varied in pre-fire amount of merchantable mixed-wood (low=7-15% and high=25-35% of the unit area), salvage logging intensity (from control=no salvaging to high=60-70% of merchantable mixed-wood harvested) and burn severity (estimates based on tree survival after fire). Six main findings are presented: (1) in mixed-wood areas subjected to salvage, total woodpecker abundance and woodpeckers of the genus Picoides (most notably black-backed woodpecker Picoides arcticus) responded negatively to increasing salvage logging intensity; (2) northern flicker (Colaptes auratus) showed a marginally significant positive response to salvage in the mixed-wood areas; (3) the salvage response of the black-backed woodpecker was season dependent (first post-fire summer, winter and second post-fire summer compared); (4) in coniferous but not in mixed-wood areas, black-backed woodpecker responded positively to increasing burn severity. Moreover, the response in coniferous habitat was stronger in the first post-fire summer, compared to the subsequent winter and the second post-fire summer. In the retained mixed-wood areas, northern flicker responded positively to increasing burn severity; (5) the majority of the detected 73 woodpecker nests with chicks were in trembling aspen trees or in mixed-wood stands; (6) among coniferous tree species, dead standing jack pine and white spruce trees had much greater evidence of woodpecker foraging than had black spruce (ca. 65-75% versus 15% of trees). These results indicate the crucial influence of salvage logging, the amount of retained mixed-wood forests and burn severity on woodpecker abundance. Hence we recommend retention of large, burned mixed-wood areas during salvage harvesting to support these dead-wood dependent birds. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We found that lower species richness, abundance, and diversity in logged plots where were controlled by a typical postfire management. As results of guild analysis for nest sites and food resources, postfire logging reduced densities of ground-shrub nesters, primary and secondary cavity nesters, but was also related to reduction in densities of some foraging groups such as timber drillers and foliage searchers. These results suggest that snag-retention is essential for birds in burned forests and that postfire logging is incompatible with the maintenance of bird populations and communities. Consequently we need to develope guidelines of postfire management for snag-retention in burned forests through intensive researches focused on some target species such as Great spotted woodpeckers Dendrocopos major.					0	1		19	2	3			Forestry	0445-4650				Forestry	53500, Forestry and forest products	Aves, Vertebrata, Chordata, Animalia; Animals, Birds, Chordates, Nonhuman Vertebrates, Vertebrates; Piciformes [85552]; [Dendrocopos major; Great spotted woodpecker]					Korea; Palearctic region/Samcheok; South Korea, Asia; Palearctic region		forest burning; applied and field techniques/postfire logging; applied and field techniques/snag-retention technique; applied and field techniques		species richness				2018-10-22	J	BCI:BCI200700198703		Article		Nest densities of cavity-nesting birds in relation to postfire salvage logging and time since wildfire		Saab, Victoria A. (vsaab@fs.fed.us) ; Russell, Robin E.; Dudley, Jonathan G.									Condor		2007	FEB 2007	109	1	97-108	97	108	English						We monitored the nest densities and nest survival of seven cavity-nesting bird species, including four open-space foragers (American Kestrel [Falco sparperius], Lewis's Woodpecker [Melanerpes lewis], Western Bluebird [Sialia mexicana], and Mountain Bluebird [S. currucoides]) and three wood-foragers (Hairy Woodpecker [Picoides villosus], Black-backed Woodpecker [P. arcticus], and Northern Flicker [Colaptes auratus]), after two wildfires (one partially salvage-logged and one unlogged) in western Idaho from 1994-2004. We estimated the relationship between nest density and time since fire, tested for statistical differences in nest densities and nest survival in the partially salvage-logged vs. unlogged wildfires, and tested for differences in nest survival between early (1-4 years after fire) and late (5-12 years after fire) postfire periods. Nest densities of open-space foragers and Northern Flickers generally increased with time since fire, whereas nest densities of Black-backed and Hairy Woodpeckers peaked 4-5 years postfire. Nest densities of wood-foraging species and Mountain Bluebirds were significantly higher in the unlogged burn, whereas Lewis's Woodpeckers had significantly higher nest densities in the partially logged burn. Kestrels tended to favor the partially logged burn, while Western Bluebird nest densities were nearly equal in both burned areas. For most species, postfire period and treatment (partially logged vs. unlogged) had little influence on nest survival. However, Hairy Woodpecker nest survival was significantly lower in the partially logged burn versus the unlogged wildfire in the early postfire period, and Lewis's Woodpecker nest survival was significantly reduced in the later postfire period versus the early postfire period in the partially logged burn. Importantly, the salvage logging was designed to retain more than half of the snags over 23 cm in diameter, which provided suitable nesting habitat for open-space foragers during the decade following fire.

Condor		2007	FEB 2007	109	1	122-131	122	131	English						Crown-burned pine forests are an important breeding habitat for many cavity-nesting birds, and can serve as a source habitat for some woodpecker species. However, it is unclear if this function continues with postburn succession as predators recolonize burned habitats and snag density declines. Lewis's Woodpeckers (Melanerpes lewis) are considered "burn specialists" and are a species of conservation concern. We monitored Lewis's Woodpeckers nesting in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests to determine the source or sink function of old-burn habitats in the Black Hills of South Dakota (study units burned in 1988 and 1991); concurrently, we examined avian and mammalian predator communities within burned and unburned areas. Between 2002 and 2005 we found 55 Lewis's Woodpecker nests, 51 of which were successful. Using adult and juvenile mortality rates for other melanerpine species taken from the literature, we determined that the old-burn habitats we sampled were acting as sources for Lewis's Woodpeckers. Point Counts and tracking tube surveys suggested that both avian and mammalian predators had successfully recolonized these old-burn habitats, as both groups were common in old burns and in unburned forests. The unusually high nesting success of Lewis's Woodpeckers in the Black Hills is likely due to the absence of some common nest predators. While the high success rates might continue, we suggest that the overall contribution of young to the region from these burned sites will decline as suitable habitat components (such as snags) decline with the continuation of postfire succession.

Species richness is high (34) and breeding densities are high (129.3 pairs per 10 ha) as well as global diversity (SHANNON index of A. 13). These results are analysed then discussed in relation to other non-riverine conifer and broadleaved forests. This richness can be explained by the architectural complexity of the studied forest resulting from the specific dynamics of riverside habitats: diversity of woody plant species, high vertical stratification, horizontal heterogeneity, abundance of large vines and vigour of plant growth are the most striking features of this habitat. Bird populations are similar to that of ordinary European Oak forest with three differences: a very high breeding density (50% higher), an abundance of shrubby habitats species in the heart of the forest, and the presence of species whose ecological optimum in Eastern France is cool montane habitat (Black Woodpecker, Dryocopus; martius, Firecrest Regulus atricapillus, Common Tree-creeper Certhia familiaris, Pied Flycatcher Ficedula hypoleuca). A comparison with the ancient Bialowieza forest has also been drawn: the higher temperatures and a much thicker and abundant woody vegetation explain the higher densities recorder in the Rhine riverine forest. Finally, a critical analysis of absolute population census tools is provided, highlighting weaknesses and suggesting possible alleys of improvement. In conclusion, we must unfortunately accept the fact that deep hydrological changes in European river habitats will modify the typical riverine forest architecture and will lead to the transformation of the Querco-Ulmetum minoris into a yet unknown different type of forest.

Condor		2006	NOV 2006	108	4	817-831	817	831	English						We investigated the effects of postfire salvage logging on cavity-nesting birds by comparing nest densities and patterns of nest reuse over a three-year period in seven logged and eight unlogged patches of mixed-conifer forest in the Blackfoot-Clearwater Wildlife Management Area, Montana. We found 563 active nests of 18 cavity-nesting birds; all species were found nesting in the uncut burned forest plots, but only eight nested in the salvage-logged plots. All except one species nested at a higher density in the unlogged areas, and half of the species were significantly more abundant in the unlogged plots. Every timber-drilling and timber-gleaning species was less abundant in the salvage-logged plots, including two of the most fire-dependent species in the northern Rocky Mountains-American Three-toed (Picoides dorsalis) and Black-backed (P. arcticus) Woodpeckers. Lower abundances in salvage-logged plots occurred despite the fact that there were still more potential nest snags per hectare than the recommended minimum number needed to support maximum densities of primary cavity-nesters, which suggests that reduced woodpecker densities are more related to a reduction in food (wood-boring beetle larvae) than to nest-site availability. Because cavities were present in only four of 244 randomly selected trees, and because frequency of cavity reuse by secondary cavity-nesters was higher in salvage-logged than in unlogged plots, nest-site limitation may be a more important constraint for secondary cavity-nesters in salvage-logged areas. These results suggest that typical salvage logging operations are incompatible with the maintenance of endemic levels of most cavity-nesting bird populations, especially populations of primary cavity-nesting species.

We measured reproductive parameters and nest-site characteristics at 17 Red-headed Woodpecker nests and 17 random sites between 2001 and 2004 in the Black Hills, South Dakota. The average date the first egg was laid was 17 June, and the average clutch size was 5.4 +/- 0.4. The daily nest survival rate averaged 0.98 (overall nest success = 47%), and predation was the major cause of nest failure. Red-headed Woodpecker nests occurred farther from grassland edges in large diameter snags within severely burned quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) stands. High-severity fire within these aspen stands resulted in a combination of snag and understory characteristics that differed from the surrounding pine forest matrix. Interactions between cover type and burn severity may have important ecological consequences for Red-headed Woodpeckers in a mixed conifer forest.

Journal of Wildlife Management		2006	NOV 2006	70	5	1379-1392	1379	1392	English						We investigated how changes in vegetation structure and prey resources following wildfire affected the winter ecology of hairy woodpeckers (Picoides villosus) in ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of northern Arizona, USA. Using point-counts, radiotelemetry, and focal bird observation, we assessed the relative abundance, home range size and composition, and habitat use by foraging hairy woodpeckers in 3 stands that had experienced wildfire in 1996, 2000, or 2002. Because we conducted the study over 2 years, we used the 1996 fire to represent 6 and 7 years after fire, while we used the 2000 fire to represent 2 and 3 years after fire in a space-for-time substitution chronosequence analysis. We also assessed bark beetle and woodborer density by x-raying bark samples collected from a subset of trees within burned areas. We detected significantly greater hairy woodpecker relative abundance in burned forests representing 1 and 2 years after fire, and bark beetle and woodborer density was highest in these stands as well. Woodpecker home range size increased across stands representing increasing time since fire. Within a burn, hairy woodpeckers used high-severity burned areas more than moderate-severity burned areas representing 2 and 3 years after fire, but not in areas representing 6 and 7 years after fire. Bark beetle and woodborer densities were also higher in high-severity burned stands representing 2 and 3 years after fire. Hairy woodpeckers used edges of high-severity burned areas more than the interior. We hypothesize that an initial increase in bark beetle and woodborer density following fire allowed for higher woodpecker abundance and smaller home ranges, but as burned forests aged, bark beetle and woodborer density within trees decreased, killed trees fell, and, in response, hairy woodpecker relative abundance decreased and home range size increased. These patterns suggest that high-severity burned areas provide important but ephemeral resources to this dominant primary cavity-nester. The higher bark beetle and woodborer densities and greater use of edges of high-severity burned areas by woodpeckers suggests that salvage logging of these areas could remove potential prey and preferred foraging areas for hairy woodpeckers, especially when trees are removed along severely burned edges.

Auk		2006	OCT 2006	123	4	1110-1128	1110	1128	English						We determined the effects of fire history and a riparian-upland gradient on the breeding bird community at Fort Bragg Military Installation in North Carolina, one of the largest remnant areas of the endangered longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) ecosystem. Study sites were classified into two treatments: fire-intense (areas experiencing growing-season burns) and fire-suppressed (areas lacking fires). Within each treatment, bird and vegetation data were recorded at point-count stations positioned at three distances from streamhead pocosins to characterize the riparian-upland habitat gradient: 0, 75, and >= 150 m. Total bird abundance and species richness varied significantly along the riparian-upland gradient, with pocosins contributing greatly to avian biodiversity. Our data revealed strong effects of fire history and riparian-upland gradient on bird species, which we described in terms of breeding-bird assemblages. Members of the open longleaf assemblage (e.g., Red-cockaded Woodpecker [Picoides borealis], Bachman's Sparrow [Aimophila aestivalis]) were most common in fire-intense areas and at upland locations. Members of the fire-suppressed assemblage (e.g., Wood Thrush [Hylocichla mustelina], Ovenbird [Seiurus aurocapilla]) were confined to pocosins in fire-intense areas, but became more abundant in fire-suppressed areas. Members of the pocosin assemblage (e.g., Eastern Towhee [Pipilo erythropthalamus], Common Yellowthroat [Geothlypis trichas]) were largely confined to pocosins and, in some cases, were most abundant in fire-intense pocosins. Fire suppression increased structural diversity of vegetation and promoted one breeding-bird assemblage (fire-suppressed), but at the expense of two others (open longleaf, pocosin). Continued management of Fort Bragg to promote longleaf pine restoration is essential for supporting conservation of the open-longleaf bird assemblage; in addition, it will benefit the pocosin assemblage.

Several species of cavity-nesting birds are non-migratory residents and consequently subject to winter conditions. We conducted winter bird counts from 1998 to 2000 to examine the abundance and habitat association of cavity-nesting birds in prescribed burned and unburned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) stands. Even though bird diversity indices did not differ between burned and unburned stands, species-specific bird abundance was associated with habitat variables in three burned and four unburned stands. Total cavity-nesting bird abundance was greater in burned stands. Most cavity-nesting birds were observed in mixed-species flocks. Individual species of these flocks were associated with different habitat variables within stands. Numbers of woodpeckers were significantly greater in burned stands and numbers of chickadees were significantly greater in unburned stands. Bark foragers such as woodpeckers (Picoides spp.) and pygmy nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea) were associated with fewer small trees and recently decayed snags and logs. Foliage gleaners such as the chickadees (Poecile spp.) were associated with small diameter snags. The juxtaposition of burned and unburned stands is important for individual birds reliant upon other members of a mixed-species flock and habitat heterogeneity within stands is important for maintaining a diverse cavity-nesting bird assemblage.

(hutto@mso.umt.edu)									Conservation Biology		2006	AUG 2006	20	4	984-993	984	993	English						The bird species in western North America that are most restricted to, and therefore most dependent on, severely burned conifer forests during the first years following afire event depend heavily on the abundant standing snags for perch sites, nest sites, and food resources. Thus, it is critical to develop and apply appropriate snag-management guidelines to implement postfire timber harvest operations in the same locations. Unfortunately, existing guidelines designed for green-tree forests cannot be applied to postfire salvage sales because the snag needs of snag-dependent species in burned forests are not at all similar to the snag needs of snag-dependent species in green-tree forests. Birds in burned forests have very different snag-retention needs from those cavity nesting bird species that have served as the focus for the development of existing snag-management guidelines. Specifically, many postfire specialists use standing dead trees not only for nesting purposes but for feeding purposes as well. Woodpeckers, in particular, specialize on wood-boring beetle larvae that are superabundant in fire-killed trees for several years following severe fire. Species such as the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) are nearly restricted in their habitat distribution to severely burned forests. Moreover, existing postfire salvage-logging studies reveal that most postfire specialist species are completely absent from burned forests that have been (even partially) salvage logged. I call for the long-overdue development and use of more meaningful snag-retention guidelines for postfire specialists, and I note that the biology of the most fire-dependent bird species suggests that even a cursory attempt to meet their snag needs would preclude postfire salvage logging in those severely burned conifer forests wherein the maintenance of biological diversity is deemed important.

We asked if current ground layer vegetation composition or stand structure (canopy openness, tree density, plus depth of the soil A layer) in 32 mixed pine-hardwood forest stands at Fort Benning, GA, reflects military use or fire frequency over the last 20 years. The 32 stands, half on sandy and half on clayey soil, were assigned to two military use categories (heavier, open to tracked vehicles, or lighter, with dismounted infantry training) and three fire frequency (# fires/20 yr) categories [low (0-2 fires), medium (3-4 fires), and high (5-6 fires)]. Ordination reflected abundance of grass and legume species, the proportion of pine in the canopy, canopy openness, and tree density and age,- it revealed a relatively stronger influence of military land use and canopy composition, and weaker influence of fire frequency (over the past 20 years), on ground layer vegetation differences among the stands. Soil A-horizon depth, abundance of disturbance features, and tree density differed between lighter and heavier military use categories, but not among fire frequency categories. Our results suggest that mechanized military training has led to a loss of topsoil and convergence on abundant pines, grasses, and legumes, while a range of fire frequencies has led to an array of ground layer composition in stands with lighter military use. Under all land use scenarios examined, 70% pine canopy may be favorable for abundant grasses and legumes in ground layer vegetation.

After declining precipitously during the 1980s, woodpecker population trends on federal lands (National Forests and Grasslands in Texas, but excluding the Big Thicket National Preserve) increased between 1990 and 2000, and have been stable to slightly decreasing over the past four years. Litigation against the U.S. Forest Service in the mid 1980s reversed a severe population decline, whereas litigation during the past 8 years hampered recovery efforts for the Red-cockaded Woodpecker. Red-cockaded Woodpecker populations on private and State of Texas lands have steadily declined over the past 15 years, most likely the result of demographic isolation. Limited availability of old pines suitable for cavity excavation, inadequate fire regimes to control hardwood midstory, and demographic dysfunction resulting from woodpecker group isolation remain as significant obstacles to recovery in most populations.

Prior to the 2001 burning season, 814 active and inactive longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) cavity trees on Eglin Air Force Base (AFB) in northwest Florida, USA, were prepared via 6 protection methods (combinations of mechanical, hand, and backfiring preparation) and monitored for postburn survival after 1 year. We collected data on a suite of variables that may be useful in determining cavity tree predisposition to fire-induced mortality. Mortality of protected trees (2.62%) was significantly lower than that of unprotected trees (6.18%), and protection methods did not differ in their effectiveness at preventing mortality. Bark char was significantly more prevalent on unprepared control trees than protected trees, but no differences were apparent among protection treatments. Mechanical clearing alone took the least amount of time and resources; therefore, we determined mechanical clearing to be the most efficient preparation method. Stem char, needle scorch, percent sap cover, and whether the cavity burned were the characteristics most closely related to mortality 1 year postfire. We recommend that the percent of the bole covered in sap and cavity height be considered when preparing to reduce stem char needle scorch, and the incidence of burned-out cavities. Managers of red-cockaded woodpecker populations can use these results and recommendations to adjust their burn program, improve the efficiency of their cavity tree protection methods, and better target cavity provisioning for maintaining a viable pool of cavity trees.

Applied Vegetation Science		2006	MAY 2006	9	1	67-74	67	74	English						Question: Do case studies from silvicultural and restoration studies and applied conservation management in second-growth Pinus palustris stands provide unique insights for conservation models?Methods: A review of management paradigms that conserve the high biological diversity and rare species, drawn from characteristics in both second-growth and old-growth stands, is presented for fire-maintained Pinus palustris (longleaf pine) forests.Results: A common assumption that old-growth stands provide the primary information for the development of conservation management strategies de-emphasizes lessons learned from second-growth and restoration studies. Primary conservation management goals for the Pinus palustris ecosystem include the perpetual regeneration of the fire-maintained forest and conservation of the characteristically high biological diversity and rare species. Several attributes, such as a sustained population of Picoides borealis (red-cockaded woodpecker), Aristida stricta (wiregrass)-dominated ground cover, and undisturbed upland-wetland ecotones, can predict a diverse and ecologically functional ecosystem. Such indicators are linked to critical structural and functional features of the system and reflect previous land management histories that suggest sustainable approaches.Conclusions: A traditional definition of 'old-growth' relying on overstorey may be limited in describing important features of healthy, diverse Pinus palustris ecosystems. Some characteristics are significantly more important for maintenance of diversity than age of the trees and these features may be present in old- or second-growth forests. We advocate that the management history, structural characteristics and landscape context of stands that harbour desirable conservation attributes (red-cockaded woodpeckers, wiregrass, gopher tortoises and undisturbed upland-wetland ecotones) can be used as indicators to identify important conservation and forest management principles.

Canadian Journal of Forest Research		2006	MAY 2006	36	5	1299-1318	1299	1318	English						Within boreal forests of western North America, the dominant large-scale natural disturbance is wildfire. Thus, harvesting that is as similar as possible to fire is expected to best maintain natural bird communities. We reviewed studies of birds (mainly grouse, woodpeckers, and songbirds) from boreal forests of western North America and conducted meta-analyses to compare the similarity of bird communities occurring postfire versus postharvest. We compared the bird communities at five seral stages and also summarized the effects of retaining large live trees at harvest. Bird communities immediately postharvest differed greatly from those postfire. Differences between disturbance types disappeared as the forest regenerated, and both disturbance types became dominated by relatively few bird species in 31- to 75-year-old forests. During the period 76-125 years postdisturbance, old-forest birds became present and bird species richness increased. However, the trajectory of forest succession during this period influenced bird communities; old aspen (Populus tremuloides Michx.), old mixedwood, and old white spruce (Picea glauca Moench (Voss)) forests all had different bird communities. Retention of large live trees in cutblocks resulted in their use by many old-forest birds, but results were not consistent among studies. Although most bird species had clear peaks in abundance in a specific forest type, no species with more than five detections was limited to a single forest type.

We wanted to determine how these habitats are colonized by this species and by which age classes. Data collected at the Observatoire d'oiseaux de Tadoussac (situated on the north shore of the St. Lawrence River (Quebec, Canada)) suggest that an important movement of juveniles occurs during the autumn. It was therefore hypothesized that in the year following fire, burned forest sites would be colonized by a higher percentage of juvenile birds than intact mature stands. In accordance to this hypothesis, there was a difference in woodpecker age structure between the two habitat types (chi(2) = 9.43, df = 2, P = 0.0088, n = 186). However, differences are mainly explained by the higher number of third calendar year birds at burned forest sites, suggesting that a part of the colonization occurs in the same year as the fire by second year birds, rather than by juveniles during the autumn.

However, with presence-absence datasets there is a problem associated with the comparison between habitats when there is an inter-habitat variation in the proportion of false zeros. Using conspecific playbacks and time of reaction of black-backed woodpeckers in burned and unburned forests, the present study determined whether detection probabilities were similar. The period of time required to detect this species was shorter in recently burned sites than in mature forest stands (F-2.235 = 22.1, df = 2, P < 0.0001). To accurately compare these habitats it is important to assure the same proportion of presence and false zeros in each habitat during the census. To achieve this, we propose a time corrected method. Because inter-habitat differences in detectability exist for black-backed woodpeckers, and probably many other organisms, caution is needed when interpreting presence-absence data in the context of habitat comparisons or when monitoring biodiversity in different habitats.

(jbrawn@uiuc.edu)									Conservation Biology		2006	APR 2006	20	2	460-469	460	469	English						Efforts to restore and maintain oak savannas in North America, with emphasis on the use of prescribed fire, have become common. Little is known, however, about how restoration affects animal populations, especially those of birds. I compared the breeding densities, community structure, and reproductive success of birds in oak savannas maintained by prescribed fire (12 sites) with those in closed-canopy forests (13 sites). All sampling was conducted in Illinois (U.S.A.). Of the 31 bird species analyzed, 12 were more common in savannas, 14 were not affected by habitat structure, and 5 were more common in forest habitat. The species favored by disturbance and restoration included Northern Bobwhites (Colinus virginianus), Mourning Doves ( Zenaida macroura), Red-headed Woodpeckers ( Melanerpes erythrocephalus), Indigo Buntings ( Passerina cyanea), and Baltimore Orioles (Icterus galbula). Those more common in closed-canopy forest included Ovenbirds (Seiurus aurocapilla) and Wood Thrushes ( Hylocichla mustelina). Few species were unique to one type of habitat, but overall avian community structure in oak savannas and closed-canopy forests was generally distinctive. Estimates of nesting success (derived from 785 nests) revealed that 6 of the 13 species considered experienced greater productivity in the savanna habitat. Rates of brood parasitism were unaffected by restoration and habitat structure. Within savannas, tract size had little effect on breeding abundances and reproductive success. My results illustrate that restoration techniques can significantly affect the ecology of constituent animal populations and communities and have key implications regarding avian conservation and the management of forest habitat in fragmented landscapes. Small patches of forest habitat that regularly function as population sinks may offer far better prospects for birds if they are subjected to disturbance and ecosystem restoration.

(charrington@fs.fed.us)									U S Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station General Technical Report PNW-GTR		2006	MAR 2006		669	21-43	21	43	English						Red alder is the most common hardwood in the Pacific Northwest with a range stretching from coastal southeast Alaska to southern California and east to isolated populations in Idaho. Soil moisture during the growing season influences where it grows and its growth rates; it can tolerate poor drainage but not droughty, hot sites. Due to its tolerance of wet soil conditions, alder is common in riparian areas. Alder can be injured by spring and fall frosts and is not found at elevations above 1100 m anywhere in its range. The species produces small, very light seeds that disperse over long distances; it is favored by disturbance and often increases in abundance after logging or burning. Alder establishment via seed is not assured, however, as drought and heat injury, pathogens, animals and other factors often destroy seedlings. Alder has nitrogen-fixing nodules on its roots that directly and indirectly increase nitrogen in forest ecosystems. Alder usually has a spreading fibrous root system when young and can root deeply if soil aeration is not limiting. When grown in dense stands, its shade intolerance results in rapid mortality of shaded stems and lower branches. It is a relatively short-lived, intolerant pioneer with rapid juvenile growth. This pattern of height growth-very rapid when young and slowing quickly at a relatively young age-means that if thinning is delayed, alder can not rapidly build crown and increase in diameter growth. Although alder wood stains and decays rapidly after death, live trees compartmentalize decay very efficiently, and pruning and thinning are feasible operations. Stem rots do not result in high volumes of damage overall but can be locally important; ring shake can also be a serious problem in some stands. Insects and diseases are not generally a problem in young stands although insect defoliators, Nectria cankers, and alder bark beetles can cause problems. Meadow mice, voles, and beaver can also hinder stand establishment in some areas. Deer or elk may rub small alder saplings during the fall with their antlers but do not usually browse its leaves and twigs. Sapsucker damage is sporadic, but if stems are repeatedly damaged, their future log value will be greatly reduced. Mortality and top damage have been observed after ice or early snowstorms. Red alder is now being managed for a wider range of objectives and on many more sites than in the past; this is due to recent increases in wood value of alder relative to other species as well as its ability to fill specialized niches (e.g., add nitrogen to forest ecosystems, immunity to laminated root rot) and produce sawlogs on relatively short rotations. Management experience with the species, however, is still limited to a fairly narrow range of sites and management scenarios. Thus, information on the biology and ecology of the species should help guide managers until more direct experience is available.

Only seed-eating species visited the burnt areas in large numbers. While certain trunks or branches were still burning, numerous birds, among them the coal tit Parus ater and the Corsican nuthatch Sitta whiteheadi, were attracted by the large amount of pine seeds made available by the opening of the cones under the action of heat. The number of seed-harvesting birds declined afterwards. We discuss how seed hoarding by tits and nuthatches enabled these resident birds to survive during the first winter after the fire in a burnt environment where seeds remained the only potential food source.

(saquilan@dccc.edu)									Southeastern Naturalist		2006		5	1	135-148	135	148	English						I surveyed bird communities during the 1999 and 2000 breeding seasons in oak-pine sawtimber (ST) stands, pine poletimber (PT) stands, high-density pine seedling (SS) stands, and recently clearcut areas throughout Holly Springs National Forest (HSNF), in north-central Mississippi. Species richness was 25% greater in forested stands compared to clearcut areas, yet total bird density was 50% greater in clearcut areas. Bird communities ranged from open-habitat assemblages in clearcut areas to forest-obligate assemblages in ST stands. Little overlap of avian community composition was observed between ST stands and clearcut areas. PT and SS stands supported avian communities where most species were observed at intermediate abundance values compared to ST or clearcut areas. Highly fragmented, closed-canopy stands embedded within the silvicultural landscape of HSNF do not support large populations of species traditionally associated with detrimental edge effects on forest-obligate songbirds. Intensively managed PT and SS stands appear to provide suboptimal habitat for forest and grassland species. Land managers in HSNF could maximize regional avian diversity by maintaining a mosaic of large closed-canopy, oak-pine stands, and fire-maintained open areas embedded among other silvicultural stand types.

Out of 24 species inhabiting old pine forests, only three (Tree Pipit, Coal Tit, Scarlet Rosefinch) were still found immediately after the fire; 1 one species (Song Thrush) newly occurred. Bird abundance declined to approx. 20%. Only the Tree Pipit maintained its previous density and continued to predominate. In late summer, nine species were seen, and Great Spotted Woodpecker, Coal Tit, and Willow Tit reached the density they had prior to the fire. Total bird abundance was minimal during that phase (63 ind./kral). Three years after the fire, 12 species were found in early summer, the growth of shrubbery favouring warblers, Siberian Rubythroat, Red-flanked Bluetail, Brown Shrike (all new), and Scarlet Rosefinch. Having dominated the previous communities, the Tree Pipit exhibited a significant decline. The increasing food supply during summer (berries etc.) supported new species (Hazel Grouse, thrushes), which then occurred at high densities. However, the number of species and the total bird abundance were still below the values of the initial communities in old forests.

Bird surveys were started in 1996 on two burned and two unburned sections of the park to determine what effects the burning and subsequent changes in vegetation were having on bird populations. Birds were sampled at 17 60-m radius point counts on each study area; each point was sampled twice per year during the main breeding period from 1996 through 2002. Total abundance and species richness differed among the four areas but no differences could be attributed to burning. Some individual species, however, differed in abundance and frequency of occurrence between burned and unburned areas. For example, Indigo Bunting (Passerina cyanea), Kentucky Warbler (Oporornis formosus), and several species of woodpeckers were more abundant on burned areas; Ovenbird (Seiurus aurocapillus), Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vemivorous), Wood Thrush (Hylocicla mustelina) and Acadian Flycatcher (Empidonax virescens) were among the species more abundant on unburned areas. As a consequence, overall community composition differed significantly between burned and unburned areas of the park, but did not differ between burned areas or between unburned areas. Prescribed burning was instituted to restore vegetation to presettlement conditions and has started to achieve that objective. Restoration also has affected and likely will continue to affect bird populations. Future maintenance of a full complement of bird species, including a number of neotropical migrants, will be dependent on presence of both burned and unburned forest habitat.

Woody shrub-level vegetation between ground level and 3 m above the ground, measured using a leaf area index, increased significantly in all sites (n = 20) previously managed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) in both longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and loblolly(P. taeda) shortleaf (P echinata) pine habitats. Woody shrub-level vegetation between ground level and 3 m also increased significantly in one-half of control sites (n = 20). During the 8 years, Bachman's Sparrow abundance decreased significantly in habitat management areas previously managed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers. Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla), Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea) and Red-cockaded Woodpeckers also decreased in abundance, but this decrease was not statistically significant. Slight increases or no changes were observed for Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis), Carolina Wrens (Thryothorus ludovicianus), Hooded Warblers (Wilsonia citrina), Yellow-breasted Chats (Icteria virens), and White-eyed Vireos (Vireo griseus). These species generally are considered associates of woody shrub-level vegetation in both woodpecker and control sites.

Pileated woodpecker foraging was significantly more abundant in the stands that were not treated or had mechanical fuel reduction only. Ants, the primary prey of pileated woodpeckers, were also significantly more abundant in these stands.					0	0		28	0	0			Environmental Sciences & Ecology	0882-5165				Pest Assessment Control and Management	54600, Pest control: general, pesticides and herbicides														2018-10-22	J	BCI:BCI200600091668		Article		Bird responses to burning and logging in the boreal forest of Canada		Hannon, Susan J.; Drapeau, Pierre									Studies in Avian Biology		2005			30	97-115	97	115	English						We compared how bird communities differed between burned and logged stands in black spruce (Picea mariana) forests of the boreal shield in Quebec and mixed-wood forests on the boreal plain in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Bird community composition was quite different in burns and clearcuts shortly after disturbance. In burns, cavity nesters and species that forage on beetles in dead trees predominated, whereas clearcuts were dominated by open-country species. Generally, snag-dependent species decreased and shrub-breeding species increased by 25 yr postfire. Species that forage and nest in canopy trees were more common 25 yr post-logging because of the retention of live residual trees. The bird communities tended to converge over time as the vegetation in burns and logged areas became more similar. Black-backed Woodpeckers (Picoides arcticus) and Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactylus) exploit recently burned coniferous forest to forage on wood-boring insect larvae (Cerambycidae and Buprestidae) and bark beetle larvae (Scolytidae) for a short period after fire and then decline. Black-backs were absent from mature forests and found at low density in old-growth forest. Over the long term, burns may be temporary sources for fire specialists. The major conservation issue for fire- associated species is salvage logging, because woodpecker foraging and nesting trees are removed. Maintenance of suitable amounts of postfire forests spared from salvage logging is essential for sustainable forest management. Climate change is predicted to alter fire cycles: they will be shorter in the prairies leading to a shortage of old-growth forest and will be longer in Quebec leading to a shortage of younger forest.

Todd; Vickery, Peter D.; Perkins, Dustin W.; Shriver, W. Gregory									Studies in Avian Biology		2005			30	147-160	147	160	English						Fire, both natural and anthropogenic, has played a critical role in shaping vegetation structure and composition of many of the plant communities of the southeastern United States. Pine savannas, especially longleaf pine (Pinus palustris), that were dominant over much of the upland coastal plain, have declined by approximately 97% over the past 100 yr. The inferred natural fire regime of this vegetation type was a fire frequency of 2-8 yr with typically low-severity fires that occurred during the lightning season (June-August). Currently, dormant-season (January through April) fires are used most frequently. Approximately 110-120 species, excluding migrants, comprise the avian community of southeastern pine savannas; and some of these are among the most rapidly declining bird species in the eastern United States. Disruption of the natural fire regime by fire exclusion or lengthened fire interval was detrimental to bird species associated with tree (e.g., Red-cockaded Woodpecker [Picoides borealis] and ground cover components (e.g., Bachman's Sparrow [Aimophila aestivalis] of the ecosystem. Lightning-season fire has mixed effects on birds (e.g., loss of some nests, but improved brood habitat); therefore, creation of patches of different burn treatments should be carefully considered. The foremost management and conservation challenge is to increase the number of acres of southeastern pine savannas burned frequently through thoughtful application of prescribed burning. Important research challenges include measuring tradeoffs among bird species and other wildlife for different fire regimes, evaluating metapopulation effects of different landscape applications of fire, and considering the nutrient dynamics of different fire regimes on bird populations.

However, little is understood about the time frame and the variables affecting occupancy of postfire habitats by these birds. We studied factors influencing the occupancy and reuse of nest cavities from 1-7 years after fire in two burned sites of western Idaho during 1994-1999. Tree cavities were used for nesting by 12 species of cavity nesters that were classified by the original occupant (strong excavator, weak excavator, or nonexcavator) of 385 nest cavities. We used logistic regression to model cavity occupancy by strong excavators (n = 575 trials) and weak excavators (n = 206 trials). Year after fire had the greatest influence on occupancy of nest cavities for both groups, while site of the burn was secondarily important in predicting occupancy by strong excavators and less important for weak excavators. Predicted probability of cavity occupancy was highest during the early years (1-4) after fire, declined over time (5-7 years after fire), and varied by site, with a faster decline in the smaller burned site with a greater mosaic of unburned forest. Closer proximity and greater interspersion of unburned forest (15% unburned) may have allowed a quicker recolonization by nest predators into the smaller burn compared to the larger burn with few patches of unburned forest (4% unburned). In combination with time and space effects, the predicted probability of cavity occupancy was positively affected by tree and nest heights for strong and weak excavators, respectively.

Jackson, Jerome A. (picus@fgcu.edu) ; Jackson, Bette J.									Condor		2004	February 2004	106	1	37-49	37	49	English	print					The presence of rotted wood is often noted in descriptions of woodpecker nest and roost sites, and ornithologists have found that certain fungi and species of woodpeckers, such as the red heart fungus (Phellinus pini) and Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) are intimately linked. The relationship assumed is usually one of woodpecker dependence or preference for partially decayed wood in which to excavate cavities, but the woodpecker is also sometimes suggested as a vector for the fungus. In this paper we review such associations and describe patterns evident among woodpecker nest sites that suggest microclimatic and microhabitat characteristics favoring fungal colonization of trees, woodpecker-favorable responses of trees to fungi, and ultimate use of the trees for woodpecker cavity excavation. Factors that favor fungal invasion and tree use by woodpeckers include tree species, growth history, site characteristics such as proximity to water and exposure to sun or shade, nature and position of tree injury, local climate, forest age and species composition, fire frequency, and human management activities. Woodpecker cavity height and entrance orientation may be related to the dispersal dynamics of fungi, which in turn may be related to forest vegetation, thermal, and hydric characteristics.

We studied the nesting biology of Southeastern American Kestrels in 1999 and 2000 at Eglin Air Force Base, FL, in old-growth longleaf pine savanna, a habitat type historically widely occupied by the kestrels. Most of the nest cavities we observed were in old-growth trees, both living and dead, and were originally excavated by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and then enlarged by other woodpecker species. Nesting success was 70% in 1999 and 56% in 2000. In 1999, 67% of eggs survived to become fledglings in successful nests, as did 58% in 2000. Nests in live pines and snags were equally successful, and nest success was positively related to cavity height in 1999. Reduced nesting success in 2000 may have been related to severe drought conditions. High nesting concentrations of up to 4 pairs per km2 were observed. We suggest that stands of old-growth longleaf pine, with little or no hardwood midstory and a relatively high number of snags, inhabited by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, may constitute high quality habitat for Southeastern American Kestrels. Therefore, loss of longleaf pine habitat, degradation of remaining longleaf habitat due to fire suppression and removal of old-growth and snags, and the decline of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker, a species on which kestrels may have depended as a source of nest cavities historically, may have contributed to the decline of the Southeastern American Kestrel.

Western Journal of Applied Forestry		2003	October 2003	18	4	238-249	238	249	English	print					Fuel reduction by mechanical thinning and removal was studied in mixed-conifer stands in northeastern Oregon between 1995 and 1997. A single-grip harvester was coupled with either a forwarder or a skyline yarding system, and operational economics, fuel reduction, stand damage, soil disturbance, effects on soil biota and down-woody material were measured in three replicates of paired stands. After logging with the harvester, the two log-extraction systems achieved nearly equivalent fuel reduction with 45.7 and 46.8% mass reduction by the forwarder and skyline system, respectively. Fine-woody fuel increased slightly in all units, but mass of heavy fuels decreased. Most mass reduction in the forest floor occurred in the duff layer with 56 and 49% reduction in forwarder and skyline units, respectively. Reduction in stem density and basal area were similar for the two extraction systems; in forwarder units stem density was reduced by 61.6% and basal area by 55.4%, while in skyline units stem density was reduced by 66.5% and basal area by 51.1%. Of seedlings and trees examined, 32% had noticeable damage after harvest. Damage included bole wounding (38.9% of damaged stems), bark scraping (35.0%), wrenched stems (28.9%), broken branches (26.5%), broken terminal leaders (15.4%), and crushed foliage (4.1%). More damage occurred to residual large trees than to seedlings. Both log-extraction systems met the silvicultural prescription of reducing fuel and protecting residual large-diameter western larch, Engelmann spruce, Douglas-fir, and lodgepole pine. While fuel, stem, and basal area reduction lowered fire risk from a model 10 to a model 8 in all stands, large-woody material for wildlife also changed. Mean log length was lower in harvested units relative to unharvested controls, but this did not decrease occupation of logs by ants or the activities of woodpeckers feeding on them. Of 37 logged hectares, 1.4% (0.5 ha) of the soil area was compacted, mostly in forwarder units, within landings, and within trails close to landings. The percent area with displaced soil varied from 5 to 43% among units and was located within trails or in intertrail areas between the trails. Light displacement of soil resulted in a short-term increase in the abundance of soil microarthropods. The effects of compaction on litter microarthropods was more persistent, with lower numbers in compacted litter a year after harvest. While revenue was similar for forwarder and skyline units (dollar sign68 vs. dollar sign70/metric ton, respectively), total operational costs were dollar sign81/metric ton in the skyline units, compared to dollar sign46/metric ton in the forwarder units. These results are discussed in the context of options available to managers for balancing fuel reduction needs with both environmental and economic constraints.	McIver, J.

We searched for signs of foraging (bark flaking and excavation holes) by Black-backed Woodpeckers on 6,536 snags sampled in 56 plots located in portions of the burned forest that had not been salvage logged. A logistic regression model was developed based on the presence or absence of foraging signs. Results showed that Black-backed Woodpeckers used larger snags that were less deteriorated by fire (qualified as high-quality snags). Direct field observations of individuals foraging on 119 snags also indicated that used snags corresponded to those of high predicted quality. Finally, we assessed the relationship between food availability and snag characteristics by measuring the density of wood-boring beetle larvae holes on 30 snags of different size and deterioration classes. High-quality snags contained higher prey densities (wood-boring beetle holes) than smaller and more deteriorated snags. We recommend that forest blocks characterized by large and less deteriorated trees be preserved from salvage logging in recently burned boreal forests in northeastern North America.

Fayt, Philippe (Philippe.Fayt@joensuu.fi)									Ornis Fennica		2003		80	4	182-192	182	192	English	print					The effect of food supply on the Three-toed Woodpecker Picoides tridactylus breeding density and productivity was investigated by comparing the pattern of annual changes in prey abundance in habitats with declining vs. stable woodpecker populations. In a burnt area of eastern Finland, where the woodpecker breeding population has been continuously diminishing, following a major increase the first year after fire, only the abundance of spruce bark beetles (Col., Scolytidae) (the woodpecker autumn-spring main insect prey) decreased through the years. Conversely, the abundance of longhorn beetles (Col., Cerambycidae) (the nestling main food supply) increased dramatically. On the other hand, in neighbouring old-growth patches where one pair was breeding annually, abundance of spruce bark and longhorn beetles did not change significantly between years, although the abundance level of the bark beetles differed among patches. Hence, my results suggest the woodpecker breeding population to be limited by food supply available outside the breeding season, as shown for other forest bird species. The finding, however, that woodpeckers breeding 6-7 years after the fire reared larger broods than earlier pairs, while brood size did not change annually under old-growth conditions, suggests longhorn beetle availability to be critical to reproductive success.

Kotliar, Natasha B.; Hejl, Sallie J.; Hutto, Richard L.; Saab, Victoria A.; Melcher, Cynthia P.; McFadzen, Mary E.									Studies in Avian Biology		2002	December 18, 2002		25	49-64	49	64	English	print					Historically, fire was one of the most widespread natural disturbances in the western United States. More recently, however, significant anthropogenic activities, especially fire suppression and silvicultural practices, have altered fire regimes; as a result, landscapes and associated communities have changed as well. Herein, we review current knowledge of how fire and post-fire salvaging practices affect avian communities in conifer-dominated forests of the western United States. Specifically, we contrast avian communities in (1) burned vs. unburned forest, and (2) unsalvaged vs. salvage-logged burns. We also examine how variation in burn characteristics (e.g., severity, age, size) and salvage logging can alter avian communities in burns. Of the 41 avian species observed in three or more studies comparing early post-fire and adjacent unburned forests, 22% are consistently more abundant in burned forests, 34% are usually more abundant in unburned forests, and 44% are equally abundant in burned and unburned forests or have varied responses. In general, woodpeckers and aerial foragers are more abundant in burned forest, whereas most foliage-gleaning species are more abundant in unburned forests. Bird species that are frequently observed in stand-replacement burns are less common in understory burns; similarly, species commonly observed in unburned forests often decrease in abundance with increasing burn severity. Granivores and species common in open-canopy forests exhibit less consistency among studies. For all species, responses to fire may be influenced by a number of factors including bur severity, fire size and shape, proximity to unburned forests, pre- and post-fire cover types, and time since fire. In addition, post-fire management can alter species' responses to burns. Most cavity-nesting species do not use severely salvaged burns, whereas some cavity-nesters persist in partially salvaged burns. Early post-fire specialists, in particular, appear to prefer unsalvaged burns. We discuss several alternatives to severe salvage-logging that will help provide habitat for cavity nesters. We provide an overview of critical research questions and design considerations crucial for evaluating the effects of prescribed fire and other anthropogenic disturbances, such as forest fragmentation. Management of native avifaunas may be most successful if natural disturbance regimes, including fire, are permitted to occur when possible. Natural fires could be augmented with practices, such as prescribed fire (including high-severity fire), that mimic inherent disturbance regimes.

D'Eon, Robert G.; Glenn, Susan M.; Parfitt, Ian; Fortin, Marie-Josee									Conservation Ecology		2002	December 2002	6	2 Cited January 24, 2003				English	online					Landscape connectivity is considered a vital element of landscape structure because of its importance to population survival. The difficulty surrounding the notion of landscape connectivity is that it must be assessed at the scale of the interaction between an organism and the landscape. We present a unique method for measuring connectivity between patches as a function of organism vagility. We used this approach to assess connectivity between harvest, old-growth, and recent wildfire patches in a real forested landscape in southeast British Columbia. By varying a distance criterion, habitat patches were considered connected and formed habitat clusters if they fell within this critical distance. The amount of area and distance to edge within clusters at each critical distance formed the basis of connectivity between patches. We then assessed landscape connectivity relative to old-growth associates within our study area based on species' dispersal abilities. Connectivity was greatest between harvest patches, followed by old-growth, and then wildfire patches. In old-growth patches, we found significant trends between increased connectivity and increased total habitat amount, and between decreased connectivity and increased old-growth harvesting. Highly vagile old-growth associates, such as carnivorous birds, perceive this landscape as connected and are able to access all patches. Smaller, less vagile species, such as woodpeckers, chickadees, and nuthatches, may be affected by a lack of landscape connectivity at the scale of their interaction with old-growth patches. Of particular concern is the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus), which we predict is limited in this landscape due to relatively weak dispersal abilities.

(sue.hannon@ualberta.ca)									Canadian Journal of Forest Research		2002	October 2002	32	10	1881-1888	1881	1888	English	print					Recent studies suggest that black-backed (Picoides arcticus) and three-toed woodpeckers (Picoides tridactylus) might decrease in abundance because of habitat loss from fire suppression and short-rotation logging in landscapes managed for forestry. We examined black-backed and three-toed woodpecker occupancy of stands in a 2-year post-fire forest, mature and old-growth spruce and pine forests, and six post-fire coniferous forests of different ages. Three-toeds were detected in old stands and in the 2-year-old burn, and their probability of occupancy of burned forests decreased between 3 and 8 years post-fire. Within 50 km of the 2-year-old burn, black-backs were only detected in the burn and not in old-growth or mature conifer stands. However, they did occupy old coniferous stands located 75 and 150 km from the recent burn. They had a similar probability of occupying stands in the 3-, 4-, and 8-year-old burns but were not detected in the 16-year-old burn. The persistence of three-toed woodpeckers in boreal Alberta will likely depend on the presence of both old-growth and recently burned coniferous forests or forests with old-growth structural characteristics. Black-backed woodpeckers appear to be more burn dependent than three-toeds, and their long-term persistence may depend on the frequency of recently burned forests within their dispersal range.

Journal of Wildlife Management		2002	October 2002	66	4	1031-1039	1031	1039	English	print					We compared northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) abundance and habitat characteristics in unmanaged mixed shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata)-hardwood stands and restored pine-grassland stands managed for the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) on the Ouachita National Forest, Arkansas, USA. To determine northern bobwhite (hereafter, bobwhite) population response in untreated control, thinned, and thinned and burned stands either 1, 2, or 3 growing seasons (Mar to mid-Oct) post-burn, we used whistling-male counts and covey-call counts as indices of population abundance. We estimated woody stem density, understory and overstory canopy cover, conifer and hardwood basal area, and the disc of vulnerability to characterize habitat response. Relative abundance of whistling males in the spring was greatest in thinned stands 3 growing seasons post-burn and in thinned but unburned stands. These stands had the smallest disc of vulnerability and the greatest understory shrub cover <2 m in height compared with other treatments. A threshold-like increase in bobwhite abundance was observed as a function of woody structure <2 m. Pine-grassland restoration provided suitable structure for bobwhites in spring, summer, and fall, but may not be adequate in winter. Further, data suggested that bobwhite density within a stand also was related to the amount of suitable habitat surrounding the stand. Bobwhite management efforts in similar shortleaf pine forests should include thinning to reduce midstory and overstory cover and frequent fire to maintain open woodland conditions-i.e., low basal area stands with limited midstory.

Ross									SIDA Contributions to Botany		2002	19 July, 2002	20	1	387-395	387	395	English	print					Pitcher plant bogs require frequent fires to prevent encroachment of woody vegetation. Little information is available on the relative effectiveness of growing-season burns for maintaining plant communities in bogs and reducing woody encroachment. In this study, the effects of growing-season and dormant-season burns on plant communities were assessed in two pitcher-plant bogs on the Peason Ridge Military Reservation in western Louisiana. Measurements were collected every month from March through November 1996 and from March through October 1997. Floristic composition and forb and woody plant density were determined in both bogs. Both bogs had been burned on 3-year rotations in the dormant season for approximately 20 years. One bog, hereafter Coneflower bog, was burned during the dormant season in December 1995 and is approximately 0.8 hectare (ha). The other bog, Woodpecker bog, was burned during the growing season in August 1996 and is approximately 0.7 ha. Over both years, we found 98 plant species in both bogs together with 94 of the 98 species in Coneflower bog and 90 of the 98 species in Woodpecker bog. No species were eliminated from either bog after the fires. In addition, all species that were present after the growing season fire in Woodpecker bog had been present before the fire. However, several species were much more abundant after the fire than before the fire. The study also contains comments on the occurrence of several rare and interesting species encountered during this study including Sabine coneflower (Rudbeckia scabrifolia), Texas pipewort (Eriocaulon texense), Red-top panicum (Panicum rigidulum var. combsii), Slender panicum (Panicum tenerum), Beakrush (Rhynchospora chalarocephala), Drummond's yellow-eyed grass (Xyris drummondii), and Rough-leaved yellow-eyed grass (Xyris scabrifolia).

Journal of Wildlife Management		2002	July, 2002	66	3	641-661	641	661	English	print					The dramatic loss and degradation of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forests in the southeastern United States have contributed to the declines of several bird species associated with this ecosystem. We examined breeding bird response to habitat restoration in longleaf pine sandhill forests of northwest Florida, USA. We compared habitat variables and abundance of breeding birds among 3 hardwood reduction techniques (prescribed spring burning, herbicide application, mechanical felling-girdling) and maintenance of fire exclusion (control). We also examined abundance of breeding birds in fire-maintained, non-experimental reference sites as a means to gauge management success based on similarity analysis. All 3 hardwood reduction methods decreased midstory hard-woods and canopy cover, and increased herbaceous cover compared with fire-suppressed control plots, but had little effect on longleaf pine basal area. Midstory hardwood reduction methods increased the similarity of the breeding bird species assemblages to those found in the reference plots, compared with the fire-excluded control plots. Species that most strongly contributed to the similarity between the hardwood reduction and the reference plots were, in decreasing order of importance: red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis), red-headed woodpecker (Melanerpes erythrocephalus), tufted titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor), and brown-headed nuthatch (Sitta pusilla). Depending on the similarity index used, additional but weaker contributors to the similarity between the hardwood reduction and the reference plots were northern cardinal (Cardinalis cardinalis), Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis), and Carolina chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). Species associated with hardwoods (e.g., tufted titmouse, northern cardinal, Carolina chickadee) contributed to greater similarity of the reference condition by decreasing in abundance after hardwood reduction, whereas open-habitat species increased in numbers, compared with birds on the fire-excluded control plots. Only the detection rates of cardinals and Carolina chickadees were not different among hardwood reduction methods. Two notable species of concern that increased in all hardwood reduction plots compared with the control, but were not strong contributors of the similarity to the reference condition, were northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) and southeastern American kestrel (Falco sparverius paulus). Our results suggest that these management methods were beneficial to landbirds characteristic of fire-maintained longleaf pine sandhills in northwest Florida. However, northern bobwhites and Bachman's sparrows may require more intensive management than red-cockaded woodpeckers, such as shorter burn intervals, as these species depend directly on ground cover vegetation.

William; Lloyd, John									Southwestern Naturalist		2002	June, 2002	47	2	282-292	282	292	English	print					We examined short-term trends in relative abundance and species richness of breeding and wintering grassland birds before (1996) and after (1997, 1998) a prescribed burn in a mesquite-invaded, desert grassland at Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, Arizona. We surveyed birds and sampled vegetation along 1-km line transects bisecting 14 (7 control, 7 burn) 25-ha plots located randomly within a burn and adjacent control unit. Following a spring burn that was moderate in intensity and patchy in areal extent, we observed that ground cover was affected more strongly by burning than mesquite (Prosopis) cover, smaller mesquite were affected more strongly by burning than larger mesquite, and mortality of mesquite was low. No change in total abundance of birds was detected on the burn unit following fire for either wintering or breeding birds; however, species richness of breeding birds decreased in the first year post-burn. During the breeding season, mourning doves (Zenaida macroura) increased, whereas Botteri's sparrows (Aimophila botterii), Cassin's sparrows (Aimophila cassinii), and cactus wrens (Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus) decreased in relative abundance following fire. During the wintering season, ladder-backed woodpeckers (Picoides scalaris) and vesper sparrows (Pooecetes gramineus) increased and cactus wrens decreased in relative abundance following fire. Beyond species-level trends, we found stronger evidence of trends and greater magnitudes of relative change for breeding species associated with open grasslands compared to those associated with shrubs. The use of spring burns on the Refuge will likely improve conditions for open-grassland species that were historically more abundant by killing smaller mesquite and reducing mesquite recruitment. However, more intense and extensive fires will be required to reduce the presence of larger mesquite. Such fires would likely have a greater impact on birds associated with shrubs, and consequently, a greater impact on the avian community as a whole.

Research indicates that substantial hardwood midstory encroachment is detrimental to Red-cockaded Woodpecker populations, although the exact mechanisms are unknown. We examined foraging behavior in relation to midstory between August 1989 and February 1990. Red-cockaded Woodpeckers foraged at greater heights in areas of taller and denser midstory in the loblolly-shortleaf pine (Pinus taeda and P. echinata, respectively) habitat, but not in longleaf pine (P. palustris) habitat with less-developed midstory vegetation than typical of loblolly-shortleaf pine habitat. In addition, Red-cockaded Woodpeckers concentrated foraging activities in or adjacent to forest stands or openings with reduced midstory vegetation. Overall, Red-cockaded Woodpeckers foraged disproportionately at heights and sites that minimized their exposure to dense midstory conditions. These results suggest that ecosystem management, preferably using prescribed fire, that reduces midstory vegetation will improve foraging habitat for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers.	Rudolph, D.

U S Forest Service Pacific Northwest Research Station General Technical Report PNW-GTR		2002	April, 2002		535	1-26	1	26	English	print					A stand-replacement prescribed fire in an over-mature lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud.)-subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) stand (snag area) and in a mature lodgepole pine thicket (thicket area) resulted in lower plant diversity within the first year after burning, and as fire energy outputs increased, postburn plant cover and diversity decreased. There was no reestablishment of the original plant cover where total heat output exceeded 100 000 kcal/m2. Apparently, most plants in this habitat were not fire resistant. Postfire recovery appears to depend on immigration of seeds from adjacent unburned areas or on seeds and rhizomes that survive on unburned microsites (refugia) within the burn. After fire, temperatures increased in the forest floor fermentative layer (FL) (10 to 19 degreeC) and upper 10 cm of the soil layer (SL) (3 to 7 degreeC) on several dates in summer 1976. Increased pH levels in FL (about 2 units) and SL (about 0.5 unit) after burning provided an improved environment for bacterial development, and counts of total bacteria and proteolytic bacteria both increased. Both nitrogen fixation and nitrification were increased after burning. Despite the apparent increase in microbiological activity, microbial respiration declined after burning-apparently because of reduced forest floor organic carbon energy reservoir. Diversity of birds increased the year after burning. New species of birds included hairy woodpecker (Picoides villosus), black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), three-toed woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus), common flicker (Colaptes auratus), and mountain bluebird (Sialia currucoides). Numbers of needle-foraging species, such as Townsend's warbler (Dendroica townsendi), hermit thrush (Catharus guttatus), golden-crowned kinglet (Regulus satrapa), and western tanager (Piranga ludoviciana), declined or were absent after fire. Responses of small mammals to fire were not definitive, but there was a marked decline in Townsend's chipmunk (Tamias townsendii) after burning. In the first year after burning, forage for elk (Cervus elaphus) in the burned area was higher in crude protein than in unburned areas, but low productivity and distance from water diminished the value of the burned area for elk.

Journal of Field Ornithology		2002	Spring, 2002	73	2	130-140	130	140	English	print					Measurements of food availability for avian insectivores are desirable, but are complicated by the range of microhabitats insects occupy and the difficulty of comparing non-standard techniques across studies. We describe an efficient method for sampling wood-boring beetle larvae, an important food of many woodpeckers, beneath the bark of fire-killed trees. The method involves taking two 225-cm2 bark samples from each tree, and provides enough information to rank most trees by relative wood-borer abundance. At two sites in the northern Rocky Mountains, we tested the reliability of this method by comparing its results to those of a more intensive sampling scheme. For 65 trees of four species, we collected eight bark samples at two different heights, 1.7 m and 6 m, and compared correlations between the smaller, ground-based sampling scheme (two bark samples) and the larger, eight-sample effort. With one exception, correlations for individual tree species ranged from 0.79 to 0.95, indicating that the smaller sample gave rankings of insect abundance comparable to those of the larger sample. Correlation strengths differed between sites, suggesting that the larger sample could be employed at future sites to fine-tune the smaller sampling scheme. Correlations for ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) at one site were very low, suggesting that wood-borers may colonize ponderosa pine in a manner different from the other tree species studied. The strong correlations produced by this test indicate that, with limited effort and training, even small field crews (e.g., two workers) can use this method to rank the foraging resources contained in dead trees.

Auk		2002	January, 2002	119	1	71-87	71	87	English	print					Reversing decades of fire exclusion by hardwood midstory reduction is now used to recover populations of the federally endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest ecosystems. The effects of Red-cockaded Woodpecker management on winter birds in longleaf pine sandhill forests are largely unknown. Examining habitat use of winter migrants, some of which are declining, may influence the selection of habitat management techniques used for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers to benefit overwintering migrants. During the winters (December-February) of 1997-1998 and 1998-1999, we tested experimentally the effects of hardwood reduction treatments applied in 1995 on winter birds at Eglin Air Force Base in fire-excluded northwest Florida longleaf pine sandhills. Treatments were (1) prescribed spring burning, (2) herbicide application, (3) mechanical felling and girdling, and (4) a control where decades of fire exclusion was maintained. We also sampled winter bird flocks in frequently burned, nonexperimental reference plots to measure management success. Hardwood reduction techniques had no effect on flock species richness, which averaged 7.9 and 7.2, respectively, during 1997-1998 and 1998-1999. Larger flocks in felling and girdling and in herbicide plots were primarily due to significantly higher numbers of overwintering Chipping Sparrows (Spizella passerina), as well as resident Red-cockaded Woodpeckers and an influx of temperate migrant Pine Warblers (Dendroica pinus). In contrast, flocks in control plots were smaller (flock size and species composition in spring burn plots were intermediate) and composed of hardwood-associated species, such as Tufted Titmouse (Baeolophus bicolor) and Carolina Chickadee (Poecile carolinensis). The relative uses of longleaf pines and hardwoods by Red-cockaded Woodpeckers, Pine Warblers, and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) during both winters best explained that winter birds present in herbicide, felling and girdling, and reference plots were more likely to forage on the same tree species and substrates than birds in spring-burned plots, and least likely to forage on the same species and substrates as birds in the control plots. Those differences corresponded to the following increasing order of hardwood stem mortality among treatments: control, spring burn (41%), felling and girdling (62%), and herbicide (92%). Repeated burning is recommended to restore the reference foraging condition because it was eight times less expensive than other techniques, which favored mostly Chipping Sparrows.

We investigated the effects that management for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis), thinning and burning >30 year old loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) habitat, had on Wood Thrushes, a ground-foraging and midstory-nesting species. Adult Wood Thrush pairs regularly moved long distances between nesting attempts (range 1 to 17,388 m). The only experimental effect we found on adult movements was a decrease in weekly emigration rates (PSI) from thinned and burned compartments after silvicultural management. Adult males preferred riparian hardwoods with sparse to moderate cover and those preferences increased following management. Juveniles remained near their nest site (x=177 m, SE=113) for an average 24 days (SE=6.3), and then dispersed a mean 2,189 m (SE=342). Before dispersal, juveniles preferred upland hardwood-pine mixed habitat (P<0.05) with moderate overstory cover (P<0.05). We found no management effects on dispersal distances or predispersal habitat use. However, juveniles from thinned and burned compartments dispersed to hardwood habitats with dense cover, whereas birds from control compartments dispersed to pine-dominated habitats with sparse cover. All juveniles dispersed to areas with habitat similar to what they used before dispersal. Small-scale thinning and burning for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers may have had little effect on Wood Thrush habitat use and movements because typical movements were often larger than the scale (stand or compartment) targeted for management.

The project was implemented in 1998 and aims at collecting data on these species each year during the breeding season. The project is organised as a network of coordinators, each of which takes care of one or a few species. After the breeding season data are sent to a central coordinator, who prepares the final report. It is the intention of the project organisers that the data and the acquired knowledge should be used to produce action plans for the most endangered species. So far action plans for White Stork (Grell 2000a), Golden Plover (Heldbjerg and Grell 2001) and Crested Lark (Grell et al. in press) have been produced. Action plans for Red Kite and for Black Stork are planned. Furthermore, the National Forest and Nature Agency under the Ministry for the Environment has produced a national action plan for the Corncrake (Skov- og Naturstyrelsen 2000). The results for 2001 are summarised in Table 1. The columns are (left to right): species name, number of recorded breeding pairs, number of sites, coverage code, and name of species coordinator. The coverage codes are +++ (well covered, all or almost all breeding pairs recorded), ++ (acceptably covered, presumably a fairly good estimate but some data missing), and + (insufficient covered, chance observations only).

As in unburned stands, log retrieval systems vary considerably in their immediate effect on soils in the postfire environment, with ground-based systems generally causing more disturbance than aerial systems. Timber harvest methods used by managers can mitigate erosion effects-for example, logging residue can decrease erosion by impeding overland flow. Ground disturbance from postfire logging can encourage establishment of different plant species (including nonnatives) and can influence the growth of trees. The removal of large woody structures typical in postfire logging operations can change plant species composition, reduce plant species richness, and increase conifer growth in the first years after logging, but can also reduce the probability that insect pest populations will build up and infest adjacent stands. Removal of large woody structures can cause declines in the abundance of several cavity-nesting bird species, including mountain bluebird, and black-backed, hairy, and three-toed woodpeckers; Lewis' woodpecker tends to increase after postfire logging. Overall, studies on the environmental effects of postfire logging are limited, arguing for the use of adaptive management to monitor effects of logging and to adjust practices accordingly.

Saenz, Daniel; Conner, Richard N.; Rudolph, D. Craig; Engstrom, R. Todd									Wildlife Society Bulletin		2001	Fall, 2001	29	3	956-966	956	966	English	print					The endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) is well adapted to fire-maintained pine ecosystems of the southeastern United States. Management practices vary greatly among land ownerships. In some wilderness areas and state parks, a "no management" policy has eliminated use of prescribed fire, artificial cavities, and woodpecker translocation, tools that have proved effective elsewhere in recovering woodpecker populations. We compared forests with essentially "no management" to actively managed forests of similar tree ages and similar red-cockaded woodpecker population demographics. We also compared sites that had received no management in the past to the same sites after management. In every case, populations in forests that did not use state-of-the-art management for woodpeckers declined severely compared to those in managed forests. Because managed forests typically used all available management techniques concurrently, it was not possible to separate and rank effectiveness of specific management activities. One exception was the Wade Tract in Georgia, where prescribed fire was the primary activity for herbaceous layer and hardwood management in a high-density, stable woodpecker population. Wilderness areas, which are intended to be pristine places that preserve biodiversity, are losing red-cockaded woodpeckers, a keystone species in the ecosystem, at an alarming rate. Collectively, 9 groups of red-cockaded woodpeckers were present in 4 wilderness areas in Texas national forests in 1983. At the close of the millennium, only one woodpecker group remained and its continued existence is unlikely without management. The very fragmented features of present-day landscapes and intervention by humans impair the effectiveness of natural disturbance processes, primarily growing-season fire, that historically produced and maintained open pine savannas with grass-forb herbaceous layers in the pre-Columbian forests of the southeastern U.S.; therefore, active management must be used if the red-cockaded woodpecker is to persist.

Condor		2001	August, 2001	103	3	491-501	491	501	English	print					Lewis's Woodpecker (Melanerpes lewis) has been characterized as a "burn specialist" because of its preference for nesting within burned pine forests. No prior study, however, has demonstrated the relative importance of crown-burned forests to this woodpecker species by examining its reproductive success in different forest types. We studied breeding Lewis's Woodpeckers in cottonwood (Populus fremontii) riparian forest patches of Colorado and crown-burned ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) forests of Idaho to compare their reproductive success, productivity, and potential source-sink status in the two forest types. Daily nest survival rates were significantly lower in cottonwood compared to burned pine forests. Nesting success was 46% (n=5) in cottonwood forests and 78% (n=283) in burned pine forests. Proportion of nests destroyed by predators was significantly higher in cottonwood forests (34%) compared to burned pine forests (16%). We consistently found crown-burned forests to be potential source habitat, whereas cottonwood riparian sites were more often concluded to be potential sink habitat. Cottonwood riparian forests were surrounded primarily by an agricultural landscape where the composition and abundance of nest predators was likely very different than the predator assemblage occupying a large-scale burn in a relatively natural landscape. Conversion of riparian and adjacent grassland landscapes to agriculture and prevention of wildfire in ponderosa pine forests have likely reduced nesting habitat for this species. Prescribed understory fire is the prevailing management tool for restoring ponderosa pine ecosystems. Conditions created by crown fire may be equally important in maintaining ponderosa pine systems and conserving nesting habitat for the Lewis's Woodpecker.

Ecological Applications		2001	June, 2001	11	3	854-870	854	870	English	print					We use the term "optimal niche gestalt" to refer to the concept that there are structural features of the environment that allow a species to thrive over and above those that allow it to persist. Analyses of the covariation between demographic and habitat features can reveal a trajectory toward this optimal state. To help identify new criteria for foraging-habitat guidelines for the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) in the Apalachicola National Forest, we examine seven years of demographic data for the woodpecker population and habitat in core stands, the naturally regenerated prime habitat in the centers of their territories. For both districts of the forest, two compound habitat variables are highly related to the average number of adult birds per social group, the average number of young fledged per group, and the density of groups. These variables are, first, the difference between the density of trees >35 cm dbh and that of trees 15-25 cm dbh and, second, the difference, in the ground cover, between the percentage of wiregrass and that of woody-plus-palmetto vegetation. Although the birds require a few old relict trees for their cavities, a regression analysis shows that including data for variation in the availability of relict trees in this forest does not improve the power of the above habitat variables to account for variation in the demography of the birds. Because covariation between demographic variables and the recommendations in the current federal guidelines for the management of foraging habitat of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker is low, we conclude that experimental tests of whether causal mechanisms underlie the much higher correlative relationships we have found are warranted. Such tests should use differing levels of prescribed fire, which has dramatic effects on the ground cover. Smaller size classes of trees in closed-canopy stands should be thinned, creating patchy openings in the forest that will promote natural pine regeneration. Traditional uneven-aged silvicultural management could adopt a target tree distribution similar to that on the Apalachicola Ranger District, which supports a population of woodpeckers that is deemed to have recovered. We think that in addition to being beneficial for the birds the proposed program of habitat management is more likely to promote the long-term restoration of the longleaf pine/wiregrass ecosystem within Red-cockaded Woodpecker habitat than are alternative scenarios.

The monitoring project was implemented in 1998 and aims at collecting data on these species each year during the breeding season. The project is organised as a network of coordinators, each of which takes care of one or a few species. After the breeding season data are sent to a central coordinator who prepares the final report. It is the intention of the project organisers that the data and the acquired knowledge should be used to produce action plans for the most endangered species. So far an action plan for the White Stork has been published (Grell 2000a), and an action plan for the Crested Lark has been completed (Grell et al. in press). Action plans for Red Kite and Golden Plover will be produced during the present year. Furthermore, the National Forest and Nature Agency under the Ministry for Energy and Environment has produced a national action plan for the Corncrake (Skov- og Naturstyrelsen 2000). The results for 2000 are summarised in Table 1. The columns (left to right) are species name, number of confirmed breeding pairs, probable breeding pairs, and possible breeding pairs, respectively, number of sites, coverage, and name of species coordinator. The coverage codes are +++ Well covered species (all or almost all breeding pairs recorded), ++ Acceptably covered species (presumably a fairly good estimate, but some data missing), + Insufficiently covered species (chance observations only). Data are particularly sparse for nocturnal and dispersed species such as Turtle Dove, Lesser Spotted Woodpecker, Savi's Warbler, Great Reed Warbler, Firecrest, Willow Tit, Golden Oriole, Nutcracker and Serin.

Many cavity trees that serve as potential nest sites for primary and secondary hole-nesting birds are destroyed by fire. We assessed the efficacy of a nest box program for the Great Crested Flycatcher (Myiarchus crinitus) at Carolina Sandhills National Wildlife Refuge, an area intensively managed for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers. During 1996-1998, we installed and monitored 330 (30 in each of 11 sites) nest boxes in mature (>60 yr) longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) tracts that were burned either in April-June (warm season) or December-March (cool season). Prescribed-burned sites were nearly devoid of snags; we estimated only 0.8/ha in cool-season burns and 1.7/ha in warm-season burns. Great Crested Flycatchers built nests in 20% of the boxes available to them. Clutch sizes were larger in warm-season burns than in cool-season burns, but fledging success (fledglings/nest hatching gtoreq1 egg) was lower. Twenty-two of 59 Great Crested Flycatcher nests were depredated and the proportions in each burn class were similar. We recommend the installation of nest boxes for Great Crested Flycatchers in prescribed-burned pine forests, but additional research is needed in these habitats on nest depredation rates and causes.

However, there have been few studies of the effects of fire on the avifauna during the restoration process. To study the effects of oak savanna restoration on avian communities, breeding birds were censused and the vegetation structure documented in seven experimental burn units (8-18 ha) that had experienced different frequencies of controlled burns during the past 31 years (0-26 burns). Data were analyzed with both direct and indirect gradient analyses using multivariate techniques. The results showed that, as savanna restoration proceeded, there was a general decline in predominantly insectivorous species, particularly those that feed in the upper canopy region (leaves and air space), and a general increase in omnivorous species, particularly those that feed on the ground and in the lower canopy. Insectivorous bark gleaners (woodpeckers) also increased during restoration and were correlated with the increase in standing dead trees resulting from the fires. Overall, savanna restoration resulted in increases in the abundance of many open country bird species, including many species that have been declining in central and eastern North America, including red-headed woodpecker, Baltimore oriole, eastern kingbird, vesper sparrow, field sparrow, lark sparrow, brown thrasher, American goldfinch, and brown-headed cowbird. The shifts in species and guilds were correlated with changes in burn frequency and the macro vegetation structure-tree and shrub density, leaf area index, and relative proportion of standing dead trees. The findings show that savanna restoration can increase bird diversity and provide important habitat for uncommon or declining bird species. These birds are most likely attracted to one or more of the distinctive habitat features of the restored savanna environments, including scattered mature trees, standing dead trees and snags, and presence of both shrubby and grassland vegetation. The findings also suggest that restoration ecologists and wildlife biologists will need to work together to achieve desired goals, since different types of savanna restoration efforts may produce different effects on the breeding bird community.

Journal of Wildlife Management		2000	Jan., 2000	64	1	11-23	11	23	English	print					Loss and alteration of breeding habitat have been proposed as causes of declines in several Neotropical migrant bird populations. We conducted a 4-year study to determine the effects of winter prescribed burning and forest thinning on breeding wood thrush (Hylocichla mustelina) populations at the Piedmont National Wildlife Refuge (PNWR) in Georgia. We estimated density, adult and juvenile survival rates, and apparent annual survival using transect surveys, radiotelemetry, and mist netting. Burning and thinning did not cause lower densities (P = 0.25); wood thrush density ranged from 0.15 to 1.30 pairs/10 ha. No radiomarked male wood thrushes (n = 68) died during the 4 years, but female weekly survival was 0.981 +- 0.014 (SE) for females (n = 63) and 0.976 +- 0.010 for juveniles (n = 38). Apparent annual adult survival was 0.579 (SE = 0.173). Thinning and prescribed burning did not reduce adult or juvenile survival during the breeding season or apparent annual adult survival. Annual population growth (lambda) at PNWR was 1.00 (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.32-1.63), and the considerable uncertainty in this prediction underscores the need for long-term monitoring to effectively manage Neotropical migrants. Population growth increased on experimental compartments after the burn and thin (95% CI before = 0.91-0.97, after = 0.98-1.05), while control compartment lambda declined (before = 0.98-1.05, after = 0.87-0.92). We found no evidence that the current management regime at PNWR, designed to improve red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) habitat, negatively affected wood thrushes.

In Quebec, where the boreal forest is largely dominated by black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B.S.P.) stands, we surveyed 140 point-count stations in 3 postlogging and 4 postfire development stages determined according to the height of the regenerating spruce trees. Species richness did not vary among forest development stages, but bird abundance was higher in recent clearcuts. Recently disturbed areas were characterized by open-land bird assemblages dominated by Neotropical migrants, which reached their highest abundance in clearcuts. Moreover, logged stands were distinguished from burned sites by the absence of cavity-nesting birds. Forest-bird assemblages reestablished themselves as soon as young spruces reached the sapling stage. However, the Black-backed Woodpecker (Picoides arcticus), Three-toed Woodpecker (Picoides tridactylus), and Brown Creeper (Certhia americana) were restricted to mature stands or recent burns and are thus likely to be negatively affected by modern forestry, which involves fire suppression and short logging rotations. We suggest that retention of larger areas of continuous mature forest might be essential to maintain these species in managed regions.

Scott; Anderson, Stanley H.									Journal of Field Ornithology		1999	Autumn, 1999	70	4	491-503	491	503	English	print					Fire is an important disturbance that stimulates aspen regeneration and expansion in the western United States. We investigated the impacts of burning aspen-dominated habitats on landbird community structure in the western foothills of the Wind River Range, Wyoming. Habitat structure, breeding bird species composition, richness, and relative abundance were compared in 1994 and 1995 between six independent pairs of sites, each pair consisting of a recently burned aspen site and a control site. Burned sites typically had lower canopy cover and depth, greater snag densities and aspen regeneration, and less shrub growth. We observed 45 diurnal woodland bird species overall. Western Wood-Pewees (Contopus sordidulus) and Warbling Vireos (Vireo gilvus) were detected significantly less often in the burned sites, while Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) and Pine Siskins (Carduelis pinus) were detected significantly more often in the burned sites. Orange-crowned Warblers (Vermivoracelata), Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis), and chickadees (Poecile spp.) were significantly less abundant in the burned aspen when burn size or year was factored into the analysis. For many other commonly detected species, we had relatively low power to detect meaningful differences in abundance between recently burned and unburned aspen stands. Bird species richness was similar between treatments. Bird species composition differed consistently among burned-control pairs, but our data suggested that intersite variability in species composition in aspen is the norm in the absence of burning.

Twenty-eight stands of Appalachian pine-oak forest were surveyed of which 14 were managed for red-cockaded woodpeckers (RCWs). Management involved removal of midstories (2.5-17.5 cm dbh) and repeated prescribed burns. Results indicate that these management practices appear to have effects similar to that of timber harvests on species composition and abundance of breeding birds. Prescriptions for RCWs were beneficial to several species associated with early successional and edge habitat, including at least some neotropical migrants whose numbers are decreasing in eastern North America (e.g., indigo bunting, hooded warbler, and prairie warbler). Management for RCWs appears to decrease habitat quality for other neotropical migrants, particularly those associated with forest interiors.

We contrasted bird communities in three replicate stands in each of 1, 13-15, and 22-28 yr old forests following wildfire and harvest in north-central Alberta, Canada. Stands were chosen from old (>120 yr) boreal mixedwood forests having gtoreq95% of the canopy trees killed during fire, and harvested sites retaining an average of 6% of the pre-harvest canopy trees. For all age classes, postharvest sites tended to have greater bird abundance. Species composition also differed between these treatment types. Two-Way Indicator Species Analysis (TWINSPAN) identified five major ecological groupings of species that differed between wildfire and harvest, and among stand ages. Correspondence analysis (CA) identified similar bird communities. Greatest differences between bird communities occurred immediately following disturbance, and gradual convergence of communities occurred throughout the first 28 yr after disturbance. Species associated with open shrub and grassland or riparian habitats were associated primarily with 1-yr postharvest stands. Three-toed Woodpeckers (Picoides tridactyla) and Black-backed Woodpeckers (P. arcticus), together with other species that use snags for foraging or nesting, occurred primarily in 1-yr postwildfire stands. Convergence in avian communities was correlated with the loss of standing snags on postwildfire sites. However, differences in bird communities were apparent up to 28 yr following disturbance, and this lack of complete convergence has important consequences for sustainable forestry practices designed to maintain biodiversity in the boreal mixedwood forest. Notably, Connecticut Warbler (Oporornis agilis), Brown Creeper (Certhia americana), Winter Wren (Troglodytes troglodytes), and American Robin (Turdus migratorius) had higher densities on postwildfirethan on postharvest stands. Lincoln's Sparrow (Melospiza georgiana), Alder Flycatcher (Empidonax alnorum), Tennessee Warbler (Vermivora peregrina), Black-and-white Warbler (Mniotilta varia), American Red-start (Setophaga ruticilla), Mourning Warbler (Oporornis philadelphia), Rose-breasted Grosbeak (Pheucticus ludoviciana), Canada Warbler (Wilsonia canadensis), and Pine Siskin (Carduelis pinus) had higher densities on postharvest stands, possibly due to the greater abundance, after harvest, of larger live residual trees and a taller and more dense shrub layer. Harvest designed to approximate stand-replacing fires may require the retention of more snags than is currently practiced. New approaches to fire salvage logging are also required to ensure adequate retention of standing dead trees on the landscape.

Journal of Wildlife Management		1999	July, 1999	63	3	803-814	803	814	English	print					Public agencies are required to manage for threatened and endangered species and for biodiversity. However, at times, management for threatened and endangered species precludes consideration of other species. We investigated how managing for red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and biodiversity at the Savannah River Site (SRS), South Carolina, affected communities of bird species that use early-successional scrub habitat (hereafter, scrub-successional species). Management for red-cockaded woodpeckers at the SRS involved both (1) manipulating mature longleaf pine (Pinus palustris)-wiregrass (Andropogon spp.) stands via canopy thinning, removal of midstory trees, and prescribed burning; and (2) even-aged timber harvesting. The former management practice encouraged red-cockaded woodpeckers to establish new colonies in previously unoccupied stands (hereafter, "recruitment" stands). The latter management practice is used to remove offsite planted pines and replant with preferred longleaf pines. We conducted a constant-effort mist net study in recruitment and regenerating stands (stands clearcut and planted with longleaf pine) during the breeding seasons of 1995-96. We hypothesized that the scrub-successional bird community in recruitment stands would have greater species richness and higher survival and reproductive rates per species than in regenerating stands. However, recruitment stands always had fewer scrub-successional species (1995: 36 species; 1996; 31 species) than regenerating stands (1995: 54 species; 1996: 55 species), and all species that occurred in recruitment stands also occurred in regenerating stands. Species which commonly occurred in both recruitment and regenerating stands had similar adult:juvenile ratios (P > 0.15) and relative proportion of adults in breeding condition (P > 0.05). We detected no difference in survival rates of Bachman's sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis), indigo buntings (Passerina cyanea), and of "combined" scrub-successional birds between stand types (P > 0.05). We found that even-aged forestry is an important management practice for maintaining and increasing avian biodiversity on public lands, as well as an acceptable management practice for red-cockaded woodpeckers.

We compared bird composition and foraging behavior during the winter in burned and unburned forests. We conducted point counts during four consecutive winters immediately following a stand replacement fire. Burned and unburned forests had similar numbers of bird species, yet species composition was distinctly different. Trunk and branch foraging species were 2.5 times more abundant in burned forest than in unburned forest. Within burned forests, trunk and branch foraging species significantly decreased from the first winter post-fire to the fourth winter post-fire. We conducted foraging observations of four woodpecker species within burned forests only. Woodpeckers used western larch (Larix occidentalis), ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa) and Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) snags that were greater than 23 cm in diameter. Stand replacement fires may play an important role in maintaining populations of trunk and branch foraging species in mixed coniferous forests in northeastern Washington.	Kreisel, Karen J.; 2802 W.

One hundred and two dwarf mistletoe-infected trees were killed by basal burning, basal girdling or by a combination of both burning and girdling. Trees began to fall within 2 years. Most killed trees (96 percent) served as forage substrate for woodpeckers. Twenty percent of the trees contained woodpecker nest cavities 7 or 9 years after treatment. Larger diameter trees of all treatments contained more cavities and stood longer than smaller diameter trees. The probability of cavity presence was best predicted by regression that included diameter and decay class. Standing life of the snag was not a significant predictor of cavity presence. The use of predictive models for analyzing the utility of snag-creation treatments is discussed.

Wildlife Society Bulletin		1999	Spring, 1999	27	1	124-133	124	133	English	print					The control of woody midstory vegetation in red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) clusters is a major concern throughout southeastern United States pine (Pinus spp.) forests. Prescribed fire and midstory thinning are the most common management tools used to restore pine-grassland communities and minimize midstory development; however, it is unclear which season of fire is most efficient for their use. We compared woody-stem control from prescribed fires during September and October (late growing season; before leaf fall) with that from March and April (dormant season; before leaf expansion). Mortality of woody stems gtoreq1 m tall was related (P<0.002, r2gtoreq0.64) to the fire-behavior parameters of fireline intensity, rate of spread, and heat/unit area. During September-October, fires were less intense (P<0.05) than during March-April, and less effective (P=0.042) in reducing woody stems 1-3 m tall in the understory and lower midstory. Because of prolific sprouting, neitherseason of prescribed fires eliminated stems <1 m tall. March to April fires were most effective, in the short term, in controlling midstory encroachment. We recommend that studies using prescribed fire quantify fire behavior rather than using subjective descriptions and precisely define season (month) of burn along with describing plant phenology.

This was the initial season of a project aiming at collecting data on these species each year during the breeding season. The project is organised as a network of coordinators, each of which takes care of a particular species. After the breeding season data are sent to a central coordinator who prepares the final report. Not all species included in this report were satisfactorily covered in 1998. Data are particularly sparse for dispersed breeders in forests (Turtle Dove, Lesser Spotted Woodpecker, Willow Tit, Golden Oriole). Data on Quail, Savi's Warbler, Great Reed Warbler, Firecrest, Nutcracker and Serin are likewise incomplete. Fulmar Fulmarus glacialis: bred for the first time in Denmark in 1998. Two pairs laid at the cliffs of Bulbjerg in northwestern Jutland, but none of them succeeded in hatching the egg. Black Stork Ciconia ni gra: no indications of breeding in 1998. The status of the species in Denmark is uncertain. White Stork Ciconia ciconia: 3 breeding pairs and 9 young fledged, with single storks at two additional sites. The species is very close to extinction in Denmark where no artificial breeding or release of storks is practiced. Spoonbill Platalea leucorodia: 3 breeding pairs and 7 young fledged at Limfjorden in northern Jutland. Recolonised Denmark in 1996. Barnacle Goose Branta leucopsis: 29 confirmed or probable breeding pairs, most of them (27) at Saltholm in Oresund near Copenhagen, the remaining 2 pairs on Bornholm. Wigeon Anas penelope: 2 confirmed breeding pairs at Vejlerne and Tipperne, respectively. Goldeneye Bucephala clangula: 66-71 breeding pairs, one in the southern part of Jutland, the rest in northern Zealand. All but one in nest boxes. Goosander Mergus merganser: 34-36 breeding pairs, all but one in nest boxes in the southeastern part of the country and - for the first time - a single pair on Bornholm, where nest boxes were introduced 2 years earlier. Red Kite Milvus milvus: 21 breeding pairs, 17 in Jutland and 4 on Zealand. White-tailed Eagle Haliaeetus albicilla: a new breeder since 1996, the species is doing well, with 5 pairs in 1998; one pair failed, the other 4 raised a total of 6 young. Golden Eagle Aquila chrysaetos: not yet breeding in Denmark, but a pair established in northern Jutland since 1996 may initiate breeding soon. Hen Harrier Circus cyaneus: only 2 breeding in 1998, both in the northern Wadden Sea area; recolonization in Denmark took place in 1992 in the same area. Montagu's Harrier Circus pygargus: about 35 breeding pairs, all located in southwestern Jutland with 20 km from the Wadden Sea. Osprey Pandion haliaetus: one pair failed at the only confirmed nest site in recent years, producing young in 1994 and 1996. Juveniles accompanying adults at about 9 sites suggest the possibility of other Danish pairs, but no acti ve nests were found. Hobby Falco subbuteo: only one confirmed breeding pair, with 3-4 additional sites where birds were seen in June-July. Black Grouse Tetrao tetrix: No breeding records, but a few observations of single adult birds at two former breeding sites in western Jutland. The species has all but disappeared from Denmark. Corncrake Crex crex: at least 80 birds were recorded, the highest number since the 1970s; no confirmed breeding, but some pairs may have nested at 3 localities where 4-6 calling males were present in May-July. Quail Coturnix coturnix: data incomplete, but calling males were heard in above average numbers. Crane Grus grus: 11-13 breeding pairs at 10 sites; 8 successful pairs fledged 14 young. Most pairs in northern Jutland, one at a site in southern Jutland occupied since 1997, and 2-3 on Bornholm. Kentish Plover Charadrius alexandrinus: 58-62 breeding pairs on Romo and Fano in the Wadden Sea. Golden Plover Pluvialis apricaria: 7-8 breeding pairs at 4 sites in Jutland. Little Gull Larus minutus: no breeding recorded in 1998, but a few adults and second-year immatures at Vejlerne, northern Jutland, during summer (1 pair bred Vejlerne in 1997). Gull-billed Tern Gelochelidon nilotica: 8 pairs at two sites in the Wadden Sea all failed (no young produced in Denmark since 1995). Little Tern Sterna albifrons: about 400 breeding pairs, most concentrated to a few sites with fairly satisfactory protection status. Black Tern Chlidonias niger: 36-41 breeding pairs at 3 sites, a 50% decline compared with 1997 (40-50 pairs disappeared from a salt marsh in the southern Wadden Sea area shortly after arriving in May and probably settled just south of the Danish-German border). Turtle Dove Streptopelia turtur: insufficient data, but the Danish breeding population estimated at about 100 pairs in 1996 (Grell 1998). Barn Owl Tyto alba: 25-38 breeding pairs, most in southern Jutland and on Funen. Eagle Owl Bubo bubo: about 22 breeding pairs although recorded at 33 localities, all in Jutland. Short-eared Owl Asio flammeus: only 2-5 pairs at 4 sites; breeding only confirmed in the Wadden Sea region. Tengmalm's Owl Aegolius funereus: the small and unstable Danish population is confined to Bornholm; no breeding recorded in 1998. Bee-eater Merops apiaster: about 5 pairs bred at Rosnaes, northwestern Zealand, 3 of them fledging young; up to 14 adult birds were present during several weeks in May and June. The last confirmed breeding in Denmark was in 1985. Lesser Spotted Woodpecker Dendrocopos minor: at least 33-55 breeding pairs, mainly in the eastern part of the country (30 on Bornholm). Crested Lark Galerida cristata: 15-19 breeding pairs in coastal towns of Vendsyssel, northern Jutland, may be an underestimate since data are missing from a few former breeding sites in Jutland. Tawny Pipit Anthus campestris: 8-9 breeding pairs, but data are incomplete and the Danish may total 15-20 pairs; confined to the Sk agen peninsula - the northernmost tip of Denmark - and the island of Anholt. Dipper Cinclus cinclus: 3 breeding pairs in Jutland. Bluethroat Luscinia svecica: 6-7 breeding pairs in southwestern Jutland, in the Wadden Sea region; the pairs are not easily found, and more may be present in the area. Stonechat Saxicola torquata: 13-16 breeding pairs, but some may have been overlooked. Most pairs were recorded in moors in southern Jutland. Savi's Warbler Locustella luscinioides: singing males recorded at 7 localities all over the country; no breeding recorded. Great Reed Warbler Acrocephalus arundinaceus: one confirmed breeding pair, and 5 singing males present at 3 other localities. Barred Warbler Sylvia nisoria: 1-3 breeding pairs at 2 sites on Mon and Falster in southeastern Denmark; only one pair known in 1995-97. Firecrest Regulus ignicapillus: one nest-building pair and at least 15 singing males. Willow Tit Parus montanus: the breeding population formerly estimated a t well over 200 pairs (Grell 1998); data from 1998 insufficient for an update. Golden Oriole Oriolus oriolus: data insufficient to clarify the status of this vulnerable species; the Danish breeding population has decreased for several years and may be smaller than 50 pairs. Great Grey Shrike Lanius excubitor: 13-17 breeding pairs at 6 sites, with most pairs concentrated to a couple of military training ranges in central Jutland; the population appears to be stable. Nutcracker Nucifraga caryocatactes: at least 6-7 breeding pairs in Jutland and Zealand; a few additional pairs may have been overlooked. Serin Serinus serinus: 4-7 breeding pairs at 5 sites, all in southeastern Denmark (Zealand and Falster).

Bird Conservation International		1998	Dec., 1998	8	SUPPL.	1-159	1	159	English	print					Laos is an important country for bird conservation. bird surveys between 1992 and 1996, the first since 1949, covered 20 main areas, with incidental records from many others. This paper reviews the status of all Lao species reported to be of elevated conservation concern (key species) in any of the following categories: Globally Threatened or Globally Near-Threatened (sensu Collar and Andrew 1988 and Collar et al. 1994), and At Risk or Rare in Thailand (sensu Round 1988 and Treesucon and Round 1990). Several additional species are covered which have clearly undergone a National Historical Decline in Laos. A comprehensive review of other Lao species was not possible, and some species which are in truth of conservation concern have doubtless been overlooked. Historical and modern records were reviewed and population trends identified where possible. Current global status listings (Collar et al. 1994) were supported, except that consideration should be given to changing Red-collared Woodpecker Picus rabieri and Sooty Babbler Stachyris herberti from Threatened to Near-Threatened. If the Lao situation is representative of the species throughout their range, then consideration should also be given to placing Ratchet-tailed Treepie Temnurus temnurus and River Lapwing Vanellus duvaucelii as Near-Threatened. Twenty-seven Globally Threatened species are known from Laos, of which there are recent records of 22. There are recent unconfirmed records of two more. orty-seven Globally Near-Threatened species are known from Laos, of which there are recent records of 39; there are unconfirmed records of one further species. Five Globally Threatened and five Near-Threatened species were recorded for the first time in Laos in recent years, suggesting that further species of elevated conservation concern remain to be found. All species reviewed were placed in one of the four categories: At Risk in Laos, Potentially At Risk in Laos, Little Known and Not At Risk in Laos. These are assessed in the light of foreseeable threats; some species may move into a higher category of threat in due course. Forty-four species are thought to be At Risk in Laos; there are no recent records of four of these. Twenty-five species are though to be Potentially At Risk in Laos; there are no recent records of two of these. Thirty-four species considered by this review are thought to be Not At Risk in Laos at the current time, whilst there is insufficient information to make an assessment (termed Little Known) for another 32 species. Laos retains a much higher proportion of forest cover than do most neighbours, including substantial lengths of almost pristine riverine forest in the Nam theun and Xe Kong basins, extensive level lowland forest (especially at Xe Pian Nation Biodiversity Conservation Area and Dong Khanthung Proposed Protected Area in the South) and considerable amounts of slope forest at all altitudes. At least 27 forest species seem to occur in globally signifcant numbers. This is probably because the surveyed forests were large in relation to hunting and degradation pressure on the populations of most species. Logging of virgin areas, hydropower schemes and clearance of forest for cultivation will soon reverse this situation unless controls are established. At least 35 of tehe species under consideration have declined over the past 50 years by a magnitude exceeding that of their habitat loss, so that they are now absent from large areas of suitable habitat. Twenty-four of them are associated with the slow-flowing rivers and other wetlands. These areas are preferentially settled and exploited by people and their birds are thus under elevated threat from hunting, habitat clearance and disturbance.Other factors may explain the declines of several birds (Pied Kingfisher Ceryle rudis and Plain Martin Riparia paludicola) in these habitats. Most other decreasing species inhabit open deciduous forest or scrub, which also experience heavy human use. Hornbills, however, occupy dense forest but also have declined, perhaps because their conspicuousness, flocking behaviour and low reproductive rate all magnify the effects of hunting. Further species have doubtless declined, but historical data are too patchy to demonstrate this. The major threats to birds in Laos including logging, accelerated forest clearance and fragmentation on a large scale (for subsistence and commercial purpodseds), intensification of wetland use and widespread unrestricted hunting. A new force with the potential to be exceedingly damaging is a proposed programme of over 50 hydropower developoments. These will inundate and fragment large areas of intact habitat, force farmers to clear fresh land elsewhere and open up access to some of the nation's most remote and pristine wildlife habitats. Conservation measures will resolve around implementing management within the recently established protected areas, resisting commercial exploitation within them, and expanding the network to cover currently under-represented habitats. For a few species, measures beyond the reserves system are imperative: these include species requiring large rivers (e.g. Great Thick-knee Esacus recurvirostris, terns and River Lapwing) and wide-ranging large waterbirds (e.g. storks, ibises and cranes). Further status surveys for all species are needed throughout Laos and are particularly urgent for large waterbirds and everywhere in North Laos.

A 1295-ha burn in 1974 and a 1590-ha burn in 1986 occurred prior to the study. Our results showed nest sites occurred in burned areas, which had more ground cover and downed logs. Birds were found in sites where visual obstruction of the sky including vegetation and burned branches was higher than non-use areas. Ninety-eight percent of nests were surrounded by burned ponderosa pine. We found 74% of the nest trees on north- to east-facing slopes. Nests occurred in clumps rather than randomly throughout the habitat. Human disturbance did not appear to be a factor in nest placement and nest trees typically did not differ in height from surrounding trees. Our results also showed that Lewis' Woodpecker nests were more common in the later burn (1986) than in the earlier burn (1974).	Univ. Wyoming, Wyoming Cooperative Fish Wildlife Res.

Journal of Wildlife Management		1998	Oct., 1998	62	4	1359-1372	1359	1372	English	print					Throughout its geographic range, the black-backed woodpecker (Picoides arcticus) is rare and appears very similar in its foraging ecology to 2 broadly sympatric congeners, the three-toed (P. tridactylus) and hairy woodpecker (P. villosus). The purposes of our study were to test for differences in foraging ecology of the black-backed, three-toed, and hairy woodpeckers following a stand-replacement fire and to evaluate the importance of such fires to the viability of populations of the black-backed woodpecker. In boreal forests of Interior Alaska, endemic population densities of three-toed woodpeckers are low (<0.1/ha), and black-backed woodpeckers are extremely rare. Following the Rosie Creek fire near Fairbanks, Alaska, in June 1983, both species increased markedly. Densities of both species briefly exceeded 0.2/ha and remained high in a 67-ha plot at the edge of the burn during the following 2 years. By December 1986, densities had declined to <0.1/ha. Black-backed woodpeckers fed primarily on charred portions of moderately to heavily burnt spruces and almost exclusively by excavating larval wood-boring beetles (Cerambycidae). Three-toed woodpeckers fed on less-burnt spruces and foraged in and immediately under the bark; bark beetle (Scolytidae) larvae predominated in their diet. In contrast to earlier studies, our results demonstrate substantive differences in foraging sites, behavior, and diet of these 2 species. Foraging ecology of male hairy woodpeckers and black-backed woodpeckers, particularly females, was similar. In all 3 species, particularly the hairy woodpecker, females fed lower on trees and were far less numerous than males in the study area, which suggested intersexual displacement from foraging sites and habitats selected by males. In summer 1985, following initial adult emergence of the 1983 cerambycid and scolytid cohorts, woodpeckers declined markedly and were absent by late spring 1986. Our results suggest the black-backed woodpecker is extremely specialized in its foraging niche, exploiting outbreaks of wood-boring beetles in dying conifers for only 2-3 years after fires. Consequently, this species may be particularly vulnerable to local and regional extinction as fire suppression intensifies and programs of intensive salvage logging are pursued following fires.

Southern Journal of Applied Forestry		1998	Aug., 1998	22	3	175-183	175	183	English	print					The effects of dormant and growing season prescribed burns on the potential arthropod prey of the red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) were studied in longleaf pine (Pinus palustris Mill.) stands on the upper Coastal Plain of South Carolina. Sampling was conducted 0, 1, 2, or 3 yr post-burn. Stands were burned once during the winters of 1991, 1992, 1993, and 1994 or in the summer of 1992. Four types of traps sampled arthropods in the litter layer, the herbaceous understory, and on the bole of pine trees. Woodpecker prey abundance and biomass were sampled continuously from June 30, 1993 to June 30, 1994. Overall arthropod diversity was sampled seasonally in June, October, January, and April of the same year. The different trap types had similar arthropod diversity and evenness, but most had low faunal overlap which indicates that they effectively sampled different parts of the arthropod community. When captures from all trap and prey types were combined for each plot no significant differences were found among winter burned plots or between winter and summer burned plots. However, certain prey types were affected by burning. Among stands burned in winter, spider abundance was highest in samples from the soil/litter layer of stands burned 3 yr prior to sampling. Comparison of stands burned in winter 1992 to those burned in the summer showed that the winter 1992 burns had higher spider and ant (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) biomass on the tree boles. Spiders appeared to be the only group affected by winter burning while spiders and ants were affected by the summer burning. In general, time elapsed after the prescribed bums were applied had little effect on the primary arthropod prey of the red-cockaded woodpecker.	Hanula, James L.; USDA Forest Serv., Southern Res.

Journal of Wildlife Management		1998	April, 1998	62	2	485-496	485	496	English	print					Despite a history of oak clearing and thinning in California, little is known about the effects of firewood harvesting on wildlife in oak woodlands. We studied the effect of firewood harvesting on population trends of birds during the breeding season in an oak-pine woodland in the foothills of the northern Sierra Nevada, California. During fall-winter of 1993-94, total tree basal area on 30 3.1-ha study plots was reduced by approximately 23% via removal of commercial-grade oaks, but all old-growth trees and trees with obvious nest cavities or woodpecker granaries were preserved. An additional 30 plots represented controls. We used point counts to derive a population index of birds 1 breeding season before and 2 breeding seasons after harvesting. We detected population shifts in 14 species (7 year-round residents, 4 breeding migrants, 1 migrant, 2 winter residents), of which 10 showed consistent population increases, 2 showed consistent population decreases, and 2 showed varying population changes in the 2 seasons after harvesting. Six of the species that increased on harvested plots appeared to respond to the presence of brush piles. Responses of other species were less clearly linked to a particular aspect of vegetation change. Although we found a negative effect of harvesting on only 2 species, the Pacific-slope flycatcher (Empidonax difficilis) and Hutton's vireo (Vireo huttoni), statistical power to detect anything less than total extirpation of many uncommon species was <0.8. Our results indicate that small-scale firewood harvests that reduce basal area by <25% and preserve nest cavities and granary trees have minimal negative short-term effects on most of the more common bird species present during the breeding season, but we caution that effects on uncommon species may have gone undetected. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the potential importance of site fidelity, brush-pile decay, and vegetation recovery in affecting species' responses over the long term.

Journal of Wildlife Management		1998	April, 1998	62	2	509-517	509	517	English	print					Most territories of the largest population of red-cockaded woodpeckers (Picoides borealis; RCWs) in the western district of the Apalachicola National Forest (ANF) do not meet the current foraging-habitat requirements in the recovery plan for this species. We suspect that more information about the relation between the diet of the RCW and its habitat is needed and would permit development of better guidelines for the ANF and other populations. We studied diets of adult and nestling RCWs and their relation to variation in habitat. We found that ants were the dominant prey item by biomass (58%). Additional major items in stomachs of adult RCWs were other arthropods, fruits and seeds, and wood. Of the 4 species of ants present in samples, 74% of the biomass consisted of eggs, larvae, pupae, and adults of the arboreal ant Crematogaster ashmeadi. Territories burned more frequently had pine trees (Pinus spp.) with a higher diversity of ant species and lower proportions of trees occupied by C. ashmeadi than did territories burned less frequently. Also, stomach samples from adult male woodpeckers at frequently burned sites had lower proportions of ants, including C. ashmeadi. More information is needed about the dynamics of interspecific relations within arthropod communities of longleaf pine trees (P. palustris), the importance of ants to the ecology of the RCW, and the relevance of variation in habitat to diets of RCWs.

Concern has arisen over impacts of large-scale conversion of closed-canopy forests to open pine-grassland woodlands. We evaluated how an ecosystem approach to habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected small mammals. During 2 winters we compared small mammal occurrence and abundance in untreated pine-hardwood stands to stands following wildlife stand improvement (WSI; midstory removal), and with WSI-treated stands in the first, second, and third dormant seasons following prescribed fire. Total abundance of small mammals was highest in WSI stands and was a more direct response to WSI (change in stand structure) than to fire. Increased species richness and diversity in the second year of this study was strongly related to both WSI and fire. No species was adversely affected by WSI or by fire. Rather, WSI and fire-reduced midstory, increased dead debris in the understory, promoted herbaceous production, and increased woody sprouting. Total community abundance, richness, and diversity were lowest in untreated stands. White-footed mice (Peromyscus spp.; primarily white-footed mouse (P. leucopus)) were the dominant species, accounting for 68% of the 611 individuals collected. Restoration efforts may be particularly beneficial to generalist species such as P. leucopus as well as to more specialized species, such as golden mouse (Ochrotomys nuttalli) and fulvous harvest mouse (Reithrodontomys fulvescens) that historically may have depended upon pine-grassland habitats. Restoration of pine-grassland communities may enhance small mammal communities by reestablishing a landscape element that was present during presettlement times.	Masters, Ronald E.; Dep.

Current land management practices in the southeastern United States often focus on the habitat requirements of the red-cockaded woodpecker without considering other species with similar habitat requirements (i.e., Bachman's sparrow). We examined habitat requirements of the Bachman's sparrow on Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, to determine if management practices directed at recovery of red-cockaded woodpeckers are providing Bachman's sparrows with suitable habitat. Comparisons between active red-cockaded woodpecker clusters occupied (n = 8) and unoccupied (n = 13) by Bachman's sparrows showed that Bachman's sparrows selected areas with a dense understory of grasses and sparse midstory vegetation. Areas suitable for red-cockaded woodpeckers were not always suitable for Bachman's sparrows. Red-cockaded woodpeckers appear more tolerant of a hardwood midstory and do not require a dense cover of grasses and forbs. Prescribed burning is key for development and maintenance of the dense herbaceous understory preferred by Bachman's sparrow. In areas managed for red-cockaded woodpeckers, frequent (3-5 yr) burning early in the growing season appears the best way to increase habitat suitability for Bachman's sparrows.

Texas Journal of Science		1997	Aug., 1997	49	3 SUPPL.	123-138	123	138	English	print					Bird communities of the West Gulf Coastal Plain are strongly influenced by the stage of forest succession, species composition of understory and overstory vegetation, and forest structure. Alteration of plant communities through forest management and natural disturbances typically does not eliminate birds as a faunal group from the area affected, but will replace some species with others and cause changes in the abundance and species composition of bird communities. Upland, fire disclimax pine savannah communities composed of primarily longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) provide mature pines for Red-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) and Brown-headed Nuthatches (Sitta pusilla) while simultaneously providing grassland ground cover for Bachman's Sparrows (Aimophila aestivalis) and Henslow's Sparrows (Ammodramus henslowii). On the mesic mid-slopes where there is an increasing presence of loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus echinata) pine and hardwood species, Northern Cardinals (Cardinalis cardinalis) and White-eyed Vireos (Vireo griseus) find habitat in the understory and midstory vegetation, whereas canopy hardwoods and pines provide habitat for Red-eyed Vireos (Vireo olivaceus) and Summer Tanagers (Piranga rubra). Transition into the wet bottomland hardwood forests increases the abundance of bird species associated with deciduous wetlands such as Prothonotary Warblers (Protonotaria citrea) and Swainson's Warblers (Limnothlypis swainsonii), whereas species associated with conifers and grassland savannahs are lost. Anthropogenic or natural disturbances that set back mature stages of forest succession can dramatically alter the species composition of bird communities. Depending on patch size, forest removal can initiate forest succession and provide habitat for early succession bird species such as Blue Grosbeaks (Guiraca caerulea), Field Sparrows (Spizellapusilla), Prairie Warblers (Dendroica discolor), Painted Buntings (Passerina ciris), Indigo Buntings (Passerina cyanea), and Yellow-breasted Chats (Icteria virens). Although current data are inconclusive, patch size, forest fragmentation, edge effect, and landscape use patterns appear to influence bird communities by affecting area-sensitive species. Of greatest concern are forest-interior bird species that appear to be area sensitive such as the Cerulean Warbler (Dendroica cerulea), Northern Parula (Parula americana), Louisiana Waterthrush (Seiurus motacilla), American Redstart (Setophaga ruticilla), and Worm-eating Warbler (Helmitheros vermivorus).

Craig; Saenz, Daniel; Coulson, Robert N.									Texas Journal of Science		1997	Aug., 1997	49	3 SUPPL.	139-154	139	154	English	print					This study reviews the overall ecological role of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis) in the southern pine ecosystem. It is the only North American woodpecker species to become well adapted to a landscape that was relatively devoid of the substrate typically used by woodpeckers for cavity excavation (i.e. snags and decayed, living hardwoods). Its adaptation to use living pines for cavity excavation has expanded the use of this fire-disclimax ecosystem for numerous other cavity-using species. As such, the Red-cockaded Woodpecker represents an important keystone species of fire-disclimax pine ecosystems of the South. Historically, populations of this woodpecker and other cavity dependent species decreased dramatically with the logging of the southern pine forests between 1870 and 1930. Woodpecker populations continued to decline into the 1980s as a result of inadequate old-growth pine habitat, and suppression of fire which permitted encroachment of hardwoods into the previously pine-dominated ecosystem. Management practices initiated after 1988 have resulted in woodpecker population increases on Texas national forests. Cavity-tree mortality and southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis) infestation of cavity trees on the Angelina National Forest in eastern Texas were studied from 1983 through 1996. The intensive management activities initiated to stabilize severely declining woodpecker populations in 1989 may have increased beetle infestation rates of cavity trees in loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (Pinus echinata) pine habitat resulting in a net loss of cavity trees over the past seven years. Initial results suggest that beetle-caused mortality of cavity trees may be related in part to ambient southern pine beetle population levels in surrounding forest stands.

It attempts to identify presently recognized biotic and abiotic limiting factors. Then, through comparisons and applications of the principles of experimental design, it evaluates the relative importance of the factors and searches for new ones. The advantage of SCEA is that it frames ecological hypotheses in a context that spans population-, community-, and ecosystem-level processes while keeping the research focused on ecological factors that directly or indirectly affect the size of a focal population. In the case of the endangered Red-cockaded Woodpecker (Picoides borealis), which lives in mature pine forests of the southeastern United States, four types of environmental factors have been shown to limit its numbers, even on public land: (1) insufficient habitat due to hardwood midstory encroachment, (2) a shortage of suitable cavity trees, (3) loss and fragmentation of habitat, and (4) demographic isolation. As part of the research to identify other potentially limiting environmental factors in the Apalachicola National Forest of northern Florida, we studied a sample of 87 social units (each unit usually a mated pair of birds with or without helpers, but sometimes a single bird). Each unit was defending a cluster of cavity trees and a foraging territory of open longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest. We then developed regression models for predicting within-population variation in the size, density, and productivity of social units from data on habitat variation. We found that variation in the bird variables was not significantly related to the sizes or densities of pine trees in these territories. It was, however, highly significantly related to the ground cover composition and the extent of natural pine regeneration, both of which are indirect indicators of local fire history. This suggests that, in addition to the four main causes, environmental processes driven by the history of fire are also limiting the Red-cockaded Woodpecker population. Additional support for this idea comes from the fact that female Red-cockaded Woodpeckers on the Apalachicola Ranger District tend to lay larger clutches of eggs in the first breeding season after their territories have been burned. Because fire history affects soil nutrient dynamics, which in turn affect ground cover composition, our present hypothesis is that nutrient dynamics are affecting the health of animal populations in the system, including that of the Red-cockaded Woodpecker. The path by which this process operates, the particular nutrients involved, and its importance relative to other factors that limit the population need to be addressed experimentally. If nutrient dynamics are a previously unrecognized limiting factor for animal populations in this ecosystem, then the role of fire is not restricted to its ability to reduce vegetation in the midstory, and managers should acknowledge that different regimes of prescribed fire are likely to have different effects on animal, as well as plant, populations.

Florida Scientist		1996		59	2	96-114	96	114	English						Camp Blanding Training Site (CBTS) is a Florida Department of Military Affairs Army National Guard facility encompassing 29,500 ha in western Clay County, northeastern Florida. Land use is divided principally among military training, timber management, and support facilities. CBTS supports a diverse though disturbed landscape of upland, palustrine, and lacustrine natural communities, with xeric to mesic pineland communities predominating. CBTS is within or approached by the ranges of at least 40 rare vertebrate species, as well as several rare invertebrates and vascular plants. We conducted a 13-month survey during 1993-1994 to determine the presence and distribution of rare amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals at CBTS, with additional limited aquatic sampling focusing on fishes and one rare crayfish. We observed 18 species of rare vertebrates at CBTS, including substantial populations of the striped newt, gopher frog, gopher tortoise, red-cockaded woodpecker, southeastern American kestrel, Bachman's sparrow, Florida mouse, and Sherman's fox squirrel. Most of the rare vertebrates at CBTS are members of two communities naturally dominated by longleaf pine sbd sandhills and longleaf pine flatwoods sbd or the isolated wetlands contained within them. Unfortunately, remaining tracts of longleaf pine are generally in marginal condition as a result of years of fire suppression that have allowed extensive invasion by hardwood species. Appropriate management of these habitats should include their gradual return to uneven-aged forests dominated by longleaf pine, with prescribed growing season fires used to promote native ground-cover production while suppressing hardwood encroachment. Despite decades of past land management practices that often have been incompatible with the maintenance of native communities, CBTS nonetheless retains a significant component of biodiversity native to this region. With the adoption of more ecologically sensitive land management, Camp Blanding may be able to serve as a vital link in a potentially integrated and functional network of inland ecosystems throughout the north Florida-south Georgia region.

Wildlife Society Bulletin		1996		24	1	77-84	77	84	English						We determined the effects of management for red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis) on white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) forage production on pine-oak sites in the Ouachita Highlands of western Arkansas. Wildlife stand improvement (WSI; thinning of midstory and some codominant trees) and burning were primary management techniques used for woodpecker habitat improvement. We compared other grass, panicum (Panicum spp.), sedge (Carex spp., Scleria spp.), non-legume forbs, legumes, preferred woody, non-preferred woody and total standing crop response during 2 years in untreated pine-hardwood stands with that in treated stands after WSI and in 3 growing seasons following WSI and prescribed fire. Plant groups contributing to deer forage (panicum, sedge, forb, legume, and preferred woody standing crop) were increased by WSI 6-fold and by WSI and fire gt 7-fold over control stands (434-520 kg/ha versus 69 kg/ha). The standing crop of preferred woody browse was gtoreq 20% of total standing crop in all stands, and was increased by 4-9 times by WSI or WSI and fire. Wildlife stand improvement alone increased herbaceous plant production. Fire further enhanced forb and legume production but initially caused declines in panicum, low-preference woody, and total woody standing crop. Total standing crop was up to 6 times greater on WSI-treated stands than control treatments (988 vs. 159 kg/ha), and this response was related to stand basal area and time since burned. Management of stands for pine-bluestem renewal should be patterned after presettlement landscape conditions using growing and dormant season burns and a periodic burn interval versus set 3-year dormant season burns. We recommend retaining mature oak-pine stands on mesic sites for acorn production within a mosaic of WSI and burned sites that dominate on xeric sites.	Masters, Ronald E.; Dep.

Condor		1995		97	3	694-707	694	707	English						We examined nest-site and nest-cavity characteristics for six species of cavity-nesting birds in montane riparian and snowpocket aspen (Populus tremuloides) woodlands in the northwestern Great Basin. Live trees and snags with DBH gt 24 cm were favored as nest sites by all species. Red-naped Sapsuckers (Sphyrapicus nuchalis) and Northern Flickers (Colaptes auratus) provided different sizes of nest cavities for a suite of nonexcavator species. Flickers preferentially nested in snags; sapsuckers nested primarily in live trees, but used live trees and snags in proportion to their availabilities. Relative abundances of excavators and nonexcavators were associated positively with numbers of cavities. Nest-site variables overlapped extensively among species; Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) relied heavily on sapsuckers for provision of nest cavities, European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and Mountain Bluebirds (Sialia currucoides) primarily used flicker-excavated cavities, and House Wrens (Troglodytes aedon) used nest cavities across the broadest range of nest-site characteristics. Compass orientation of nest-cavity entrances was strongly bimodal, with most facing east or southwest. Cavity entrances of species that foraged largely outside of riparian woodlands were oriented toward woodland edge, in contrast to nest cavities used by species that foraged largely within riparian woodlands. Snowpocket woodlands were much more extensive than riparian aspen, but birds strongly preferred riparian aspen stands as nesting habitats, presumably due to the scarcity of large aspen in snowpockets. Nest cavities appear to be a limiting resource with high potential for interspecific nest-site competition in these woodlands. Decades of livestock overuse and fire suppression have greatly diminished the availability of large aspen in riparian habitats throughout the region.	Dobkin, David S.; High Desert Ecol. Res.

Conservation Biology		1995		9	5	1041-1058	1041	1058	English						During the two breeding seasons immediately following the numerous and widespread fires of 1988, I estimated bird community composition in each of 34 burned-forest sites in western Montana and northern Wyoming. I detected an average of 45 species per site and a total of 87 species in the sites combined. A compilation of these data with bird-count data from more than 200 additional studies conducted across 15 major vegetation cover types in the northern Rocky Mountain region showed that 15 bird species are generally more abundant in early post-fire communities than in any other major cover type occurring in the northern Rockies. One bird species (Black-backed Woodpecker, Picoides arcticus) seems to be nearly restricted in its habitat distribution to standing dead forests created by stand-replacement fires. Bird communities in recently burned forests are different in composition from those that characterize other Rocky Mountain cover types (including early-successional clearcuts) primarily because members of three feeding guilds are especially abundant therein: woodpeckers, flycatchers, and seedeaters. Standing, fire-killed trees provided nest sites for nearly two-thirds of 31 species that were found nesting in the burned sites. Broken-top snags and standing dead aspens were used as nest sites for cavity-nesting species significantly more often than expected on the basis of their relative abundance. Moreover, because nearly all of the broken-top snags that were used were present before the fire, forest conditions prior to a fire (especially the presence of snags) may be important in determining the suitability of a site to cavity-nesting birds after a fire. For bird species that were relatively abundant in or relatively restricted to burned forests, stand-replacement fires may be necessary for long-term maintenance of their populations. Unfortunately, the current fire policy of public land-management agencies does not encourage maintenance of stand-replacement fire regimes, which may be necessary for the creation of conditions needed by the most fire-dependent bird species. In addition, salvage cutting may reduce the suitability of burned-forest habitat for birds by removing the most important element sbd standing, fire-killed trees sbd needed for feeding, nesting, or both by the majority of bird species that used burned forests.

Journal of Wildlife Management		1995		59	1	56-67	56	67	English						Plans exist to restore the fire-dependent pine (Pinus spp.)-grassland community in Ouachita National Forest and potentially throughout the southeastern United States to benefit the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker (Picoides borealis). Restoration and management techniques include wildlife stand improvement (WSI; thinning of midstory and codominant trees) and prescribed fire. We evaluated how habitat improvement for the red-cockaded woodpecker affected other breeding bird species. We compared avian species frequency of occurrence and abundance during 2 breeding seasons in untreated pine-hardwood stands with that in treated stands after WSI and in 3 growing seasons following WSI and prescribed fire. Total bird densities were highest (P = 0.037) in the second growing season following WSI and fire and lowest in the control, whereas species richness did not differ (P = 0.399) among treatments. Densities of ground/ shrub-foraging and shrub-nesting species increased (P = 0.002 and 0.002, respectively) the most following WSI and fire. Only ground-nesting species were more abundant (P lt 0.001) in untreated stands than in treated stands. Restoration efforts may be beneficial to neotropical migrant species such as eastern woodpewee (Contopus virens) and prairie warbler (Dendroica discolor), in addition to declining species of regional interest such as red-cockaded woodpecker, Bachman's sparrow (Aimophila aestivalis), and northern bobwhite (Colinus virginianus) that depend upon pine-grassland habitats.

The number of groups and number of individuals in a 3795-ha area that was surveyed in 1977 and 1989-1990 declined by 62% and 75%, respectively. The productivity of the population was low during 1989-1990; 0.69 young were fledged per nesting attempt. To assess the adequacy of foraging habitat, forest structure was measured in an area with a high density of groups (1.95/km-2) in 1990 and in an area where the group density had declined from 2.92 groups/km-2 in 1977 to 0.74 groups/km-2 in 1990. Forest structure in both areas was adequate but approached the limits recommended in the Red-cockaded Woodpecker Recovery Plan. To determine if isolation of groups was related to population decline, we estimated nearest neighbor distances from cluster locations (a cluster is the cavity trees used by a group of woodpeckers) in 1977 and 1990. Cluster sites had longer nearest neighbor distances in 1977 than in 1990, which may indicate that isolation by distance reduces the influx of dispersing breeders from elsewhere in the population. Periodic fires occur naturally in the MCWA but have been suppressed since 1926. Re-establishment of a fire regime is important in maintaining the integrity of the MCWA and may be beneficial to its red-cockaded woodpecker population.	Kelly, Jeffrey F.; Dep. Biol., Colo.

Most shrub-dwelling birds preferred older stands (> 10 yr since last fire) with taller shrubs, or intermediate stands (4 yr since last fire) than recently burned stands (1-2 yr since last fire). Five species were negatively correlated with percent burn in stands burned 1-2 yr previously. The downy woodpecker was most abundant in recently burned areas. Densities of three species of woodpeckers and the northern bobwhite were positively correlated with snag density. The results suggest that extensive burns occurring every 4 yr or less are likely to have a negative influence on shrub-dwelling birds that are a natural component of these coastal communities.

Bark beetles (53%), wind snap (30%), and fire (7%) were the major causes of cavity tree mortality. Bark beetles were the major cause of mortality in loblolly (Pinus taeda) and shortleaf (P. echinata) pines, whereas fire was the major cause in longleaf pines (P. palustris). Cavity trees on the Angelina National Forest (NF) were dying at a higher rate than new, complete cavities were being excavated. Cavity enlargement by pileated woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus) on the Angelina NF was substantial, with 20% (49/249) of the cavity trees being enlarged over 7 years. To reduce cavity tree mortality, site disturbances in cluster areas (e.g., midstory control, prescribed burning, thinning) should be minimized during years when southern pine beetle (Dendroctonus frontalis) populations are elevated. Careful planning of timber cutting to avoid funneling wind into cluster areas might reduce wind damage to cavity trees.

There were many old and decayed trees, down logs, and abundnat mast. The forest were dynamic, changing with plant succession and influenced by numerous other factors such as fire, insects, disease, ice and wind storms, flooding and activities of native Americans. Most early accounts describe a plethora of wildlife in the diverse forests. Bird communities were abundant and diverse, probably with numerous cavity nesters and species associated with mature forests. The passenger pigeon and Carolina parakeet, once abundant and widely distributed in these forests, are extinct today. Early records reveal that the eastern wild turkey was abundant enough to be a food staple for early settlers. The red-cockaded woodpecker was probably abundant in the frequently burned longleaf pine forests of the Southeast. Squirrels and white-tailed deer were abundant in the diverse forests. Deer were a diet staple of native Americans and the hides became a major item of commerce. Large carnivores, such as black bears and cougars, were relatively abundant.

Stands were surveyed six times each spring using 8-minute counts at 12 counting stations spaced 150 or 100 m apart. More than 115,000 birds were detected. We counted 41 species that regularly used Douglas-fir forests > 40 years old, after the exclusion of raptorial nocturnal, and poorly detected species. The most widespread and abundant species were chestnut-backed chickadee, western flycatcher, winter wren, hermit and Townsend's warblers, and golden-crowned kinglet. All bird species significantly more abundant in forests > 80 years old in at least two of three regions at P .ltoreq. 0.10 were hole or bark nesters: red-breasted sapsucker, brown creeper, chestnut-backed chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, and Vaux's swift. Results suggested that patterns of bird abundance were regionally distinct, even though the study design differed between regions. Total bird abundance, species richness, and bird abundance in four spatial-foraging guilds (aerial, bark, canopy, and understory) were significantly higher in the Oregon Coast Ranges than in the southern Washington or Oregon Cascade Range. Aerial and bark guilds showed strong differences among age-classes: the aerial guild reached its highest abundance in young and old growth and the bark guild was least abundant in young and highest in old growth. Vegetation characteristics used for multiple linear regression models predicted only a small proportion of the variance in bird abundance.

Our inference was supported by (1) documentation of colonization (new clans using new colony sites) in both surveyed and nonsurveyed compartments; (2) an actual increase in number of clans in surveyed compartments; and (3) an actual increase in the number of clans in a group of nonsurveyed compartments. Fourteen of 19 new clans were occupying new colony sites < 400 m to 2,440 m from an adjacent colony. Two of these 14 colonizations were observed to be formed by pioneering, and were 520 m and 1,530 m from another colony. Either pioneering or budding was suspected in the formation of the 12 remaining new colonies, depending upon the distance the new colony was from another colony. Although only 1% of males were estimated to have colonized, colonization appears to be an important factor in the population biology of the species. The population increase was attributable to: (1) a large inventory of pine sawtimber, (2) availability of old trees for cavity excavation, (3) control of hardwood midstory with prescribed fire, (4) protection of cavity trees, and (5) provision of adequate foraging habitat. The lack of any of these factors probably would have prevented a population increase. Despite a net increase in number of clans, colonies were being abandoned at a rate of 1.1% annually. This loss was thought to be caused by encroachment of hardwood and pine midstories around cavity trees.

To understand the role of habitat loss in this decline, we examined patterns of habitat occupancy by this species in two areas of South Carolina [USA]. At both sites we recorded relatively high densities of breeding sparrows in mature (> 80 yr old) pine stands, and relatively low densities in young pine stands. Habitat occupancy varied between sites in clearcuts and middle-aged pine stands. Sparrows used areas with open understories and dense ground covers of grasses and forbs. Habitat occupancy differed between the two main study areas because these preferred vegetation characteristics were found in different habitats in the two areas. Timber management practices (especially burning rotations, site-preparation techniques, and thinning) have a strong effect on understory vegetation and, therefore, habitat suitability for the sparrow. Management practices that produce suitable habitat for Re-cockaded Woodpeckers (Picoides borealis) also provide habitat for Bachman's Sparrow. We believe that, even though the sparrow may use open habitats that appear to be relatively common, its habitat requirements are relatively strict, and that habitat loss may be an important factor in this species' population decline.

Colony sites found by Wood (16) were visited and 51.4% were inactive. Annual mortality of cavity trees ranged from 5.2 to 6.8%. Red-cockaded woodpecker populations in Oklahoma appear to have declined because of land-use change. Population decline on the McCurtain County Wilderness Area is attributed to plant succession beyond previous fire disclimax. Reintroduction of fire in the Wilderness Area will be necessary to restore the species habitat to its former status. The first known occurrence of range expansion, in Oklahoma, following re-establishment of suitable habitat is also reported here.

Active nests (561) of 18 CNB species, including 9 excavators, were located. Characteristics of nest trees were compared among bird species and to a sample of available trees using univariate and multivariate analyses. Overall, 72% of the nests were in standing dead trees (snags); only 7% of available standing trees were dead. Compared to available trees, nest trees were larger in diameter, surrounded by a larger number of snags > 23 cm diameter at breast height (dbh), had more bark cover, and were more often broken-topped white fir (Abies concolor). Diameter was the most consistently important difference observed between nest trees and trees available to each bird species. Comparisons of nest sites among bird species showed that tree height varied most. Interspecific differences in nest hole height were completely explained by these tree height differences. Bird species also differed in their preferences for tree decay-states. Bark-gleaning species tended to nest in well decayed, softer snags; timber-drilling species nested in sounder snags. These differences suggested that little interspecific competition for nest sites occurred in this bird community. Most (67%) of the nest cavities occupied by nonexcavators were created by excavators (woodpeckers and nuthatches). Brown creepers (Certhia americana) did not depend on excavators for holes and chose trees that were different from those of other CNB. Foraging behavior observations (1026) of 10 bird species were recorded. All species except brown creepers and pygmy nuthatches (Sitta pygmaea) and red-breasted nuthatches (S. canadensis) foraged on snags more often than predicted from snag availability. Birds preferred to forage on trees 23-53 cm dbh; morphologically similar species tended to feed at different tree heights. Differences in foraging method, rather than differences in microhabitat, were more responsible for foraging segregation. Cavity-nesting bird density increased in proportion to snag density on 7 study plots. CNB density declined 77% after snag removal on a burned plot, but 2 CNB species nested in remaining stumps. Density of CNB varied from 19 to 65 pairs/40 ha on 6 other plots and was most strongly correlated with density of snags > 38 cm dbh. CNB density was not correlated with any live vegetation variable. Yearly changes in CNB density from 1966-1979 were highly negatively correlated with annual precipitation. Winter weather apparently influenced density through direct mortality or by inducing movements to or from the study plots, suggesting that winter habitat may be critical. An estimated 423 suitable soft snags (15 yr or older) per 40 ha were required to support maximum bird densities on burned forests, and .apprx. 4 hard snags were required to produce 1 soft snag. On unburned forests, 342 suitable snags (1/3 hard) were required/40 ha. Snag suitability could be predicted using diameter, bark cover and top condition. Snags should be managed as dispersed clumps rather than as isolated individuals to meet nesting and feeding requirements. Providing sufficient numbers of large-diameter snags on managed stands often will require retention of trees and selected stands beyond the usual rotation period or retention of existing patches of old-growth timber. Recommendations for future research emphasize winter habitat studies and more detailed nesting and foraging studies.

A wildfire burned through the area in Aug. The following spring the same quadrat was resurveyed to determine the 1st yr changes in bird populations. Species and guilds were compared by density, territorial space, existence energy and importance values. Twelve species had territories in the study grid before the fire [Dendroica castanea, D. fusca, Parus hudsonicus, Vireo olivaceus, Regulus calendula, V. solitarius, D. coronata, Certhia familiaris, Sitta canadensis, Catharus guttatus, Seiurus aurocapillus, Troglodytes troglodytes]; six [V. olivaceus, V. solitarius, Sitta canadensis, C. guttatus, Seiurus aurocapillus, T. troglodytes] were not there the following spring, but 8 additional species [Nuttallornis borealis, Picoides arcticus, Catharsus minimus, C. ustulatus, Carpodacus purpureus, Turdus migratorious, Junco hyemalis and Zonotrichia albicollis] had established territories. Tree-foliage searchers had the greatest importance value before the fire and ground-brush foragers the greatest value afterwards. Density, total biomass, and combined existence energy of birds decreased after the fire by 50, 23 and 41%, respectively, but species using the area after the fire were 63% heavier on the average. Average energy consumption per unit of body weight was calculated to be 23% less after the fire. Fire apparently reduced the total food available for birds, but increased the kinds of food, especially at or near the ground.

In this century 132 spp. have proved to breed in the Veluwe. Some of them have disappeared (white stork, Montagu's harrier, golden plover, ruff), others are extremely rare (peregrine, bittern, little bittern, shoveler, corncrake). The raven has recently been re-introduced. No other part of The Netherlands is as rich in raptors as the Veluwe. Regular species include buzzard, honey-buzzard, sparrowhawk, goshawk, hobby and kestrel. Breeding owls are barn-owl, tawny owl, long-eared owl, little owl, and short-eared owl. The heathlands hold black grouse curlew, wood-lark, wheatear and stonechat. Some sandy spots still hold a few tawny pipits. There are many interesting woodland birds, like black woodpecker, wryneck, woodcock, nightingale, wood-warbler, firecrest, hawfinch and golden oriole. Siskin and crossbill breed sporadically. Relative abundance and distribution data are included.

The disease has been found in 18 states. It is known to spread by root grafts but the means of long distance spread are not understood. Unless the fungus is introduced into the vascular system of the plant, infection will not occur. As soon as infection occurs it spreads rapidly throughout the vascular system. The tree is known to produce spore mats for 3 to 9 months after death. Squirrels, woodpeckers, and insects, for example fruit flies, may serve to disseminate the fungus. Diseased oaks should be cut and burned as soon as discovered and if feasible the area between them and nearby oaks should be trenched to sever root connections. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: Karl Dressel	Moderator-U.

AUK		1948		65	(2)	225-260	225	260	English						Tripsurus chrysauchen is endemic in an isolated region of lowland rain-forest on the Pacific side of Costa Rica and extreme w. Panama. It nests and sleeps in holes high up in fire-killed trees near the forest edge, or in dead trees just within the edge of the forest; both sexes may share in carving these holes, or the male may carve them alone. The breeding season extends from late March to June; a single brood is reared each year, but if the first attempt is unsuccessful the pair may try at least twice more. Male and female occupy the nest cavity by night, whether it contains eggs or young; by day the 2 alternate in incubation, replacing each other more frequently than most other woodpeckers. The young are fed by solid food, not by regurgitation; they remain in the nest about 33 days, during which period the nest is carefully cleaned by the parents. Three is the maximum number of young known to be fledged in any nest; in 6 broods there were 13 males and 3 females. After the young begin to fly, they return in late afternoon to sleep with both parents in the nest hole; in some cases they are fed by the parents after their return as though they were nestlings, and the adults continue to remove waste matter from the nest. The young may continue to sleep with the parents until they are nearly a year old, but some families carve new holes after a month or so and move into them. Compared with other birds, golden-napes go to rest early and become active late; the female tends to be the last to retire and the first to emerge. This sp. loses many nesting holes to the 2 spp. of Tityra that occur in the same region; the tityras fill the woodpeckers' cavities with leaves and sticks, and when the woodpeckers tire of removing this foreign material they carve new holes close by. One male golden-nape drove the female from the nest, and incubated and slept alone in the hole with the eggs; even after a partial reconciliation with his mate, he did most of the work of attending the nestlings. Incomplete studies of Pu-cheran's woodpecker (Tripsurus pucherani) and the crimson-bellied black woodpecker (T. cruentatus) indicate that they have the same type of life history as the golden-naped woodpecker. A classification of the woodpeckers according to the pattern of their life history is given. Tripsurus is distinguished from Centurus by fundamental differences in life history as well as by morph. characters. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: O. J.

Natl. Park, Colorado, between elevations of 7800 and 11,000 ft. are subject to several fungus diseases, chief among which is dieback, caused by Cytospora chrysosperma. The infection is introduced into healthy trees through wounds in the bark, produced by inanimate physical agencies and by animals. Bighorn sheep have a negligible influence. Elk, however, have seriously injured the bark on most of the aspen on their winter range. Their habit of chewing patches of bark may be due to a need for substances within the bark; or it may be associated with the fact that the other forage on the winter range is seriously overgrazed. The few elk re-introduced into the park area in 1912 and 1913 had multiplied to about 1200 by 1940; the concentration of these elk on their restricted winter range near Estes Park is probably responsible for the magnitude of the damage to aspen in that region. Mule deer, by browsing the young shoots, are preventing adequate reproductive growth in the groves. Beavers destroy stands adjacent to their colonies. Other mammals have a lesser effect upon the condition of the aspen in the park. Of birds, 2 spp. of sapsuckers[long dash]Sphyrapicus varius nuchalis and S. thyroideus nataliae[long dash]seriously scar many trees by drilling. It is doubtful that the stands of aspen in this area can long survive these conditions. Of inanimate causes, wind-throw, scraping of branches against each other, snowslides. fire and a number of other conditions produce scars that may allow fungus infections. Human activity, especially camping, has a noticeable local effect, but probably is of secondary importance. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: -F. M. Packard	U.

U S DEPT AGRIC CIRC		1942		626		1-19	1	19	English						The problem of the control of the locust borer (Cyllene robiniae) is assuming increasing importance in the farm economy of the Midwest and central South, because of recent extensive planting of black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) in soil-conservation programs on soils badly eroded by wind or water and severely depleted of soil nutrients. Such plantings furnish an ideal environment for the borer and create conditions favorable for high larval survival and subsequent severe damage. Recent investigations, covering a 7-yr. period, carried on at Columbus, Ohio, have shown a close relationship between damage by the borer and tree vigor. The more vigorous the tree the less is the borer damage. Important among the factors that reduce tree vigor and increase its susceptibility to borer injury are drought, fire, and grazing of livestock. Certain silvicultural methods designed to improve growing conditions have demonstrated considerable promise in borer control. These include clear-cutting, thinning, mulching, mixed planting, and the use of superior vars. of black locust. Clear-cutting applies in slowly growing stands where later growth is rapid in sprouts which develop from the stumps; thinning applies in moderately growing stands where the more slowly growing and highly susceptible understory trees are removed; mixed planting shows promise in the establishment of new plantations; mulching is limited to trees of high value. Control other than silvical includes that by natural enemies, with woodpeckers the most important, and by spraying with ortho-dichlorobenzene, the most promising material yet developed, but too expensive for general use. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: R.

Chances for survival of the Whooping Crane are only slightly better. The Trumpeter Swan has made a slow but encouraging increase to about 190 birds in the U. S. and 500 in Canada, but is by no means out of danger. Food resources of the Everglades Kite have been depleted by drainage, drouth, and fires. Continual indiscriminating predator campaigns, unwise drainage for mosquito and flood control, water diversion projects, and drouth and fires in the Florida Everglades have unfavorably affected bird life. Local shrinkages of faunas are alarming because they are not as obvious as continental shrinkages. On the other hand, bettejr law enforcment, increased habitat restoration, educational work and establishment of refuges and other protected areas are encouraging developments. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: V.

The different generations overlap. The [male] and [female] beetles have a feeding period (reifungsfrass) of about 10 days. This is done with preference on healthy trees. The beetles attack the trees often on old wound scars. Trees other than elm are not generally attacked; on prune and apple trees the feeding was superficial. Infection by Graphium probably occurs during the reifungsfrass. The wood is discolored extending from these areas. The bark is not directly infected from the wood, but by beetles laden with spores which enter it. Spores of G. ulmi were found in the galleries of the mother beetle; the fungus existing on the residues, and the pupal chamber furnishes excellent conditions for its sporulation fructification. G. ulmi was reisolated from a twig artificially infested with beetles during their reifungsfrass and which died afterwards. Spraying with bordeaux mixture and lead arsenate gave no satisfactory results. Better results were obtained with trap trees. The bark of these must be burned before 5 weeks have elapsed. During the summer it is thought the infected twigs of diseased trees should be destroyed every 6 weeks. From bark containing larvae which was buried 40 cm. in the soil, a part of the beetles developed normally and emerged. Placing felled trees in water did not kill all the beetles. One of the most important parasites of the beetle was Coeloides scolyticida; in some places 89% of the beetles were parasitized. The nematode, Rhabditolaimus leuckarti, was found in larvae. Woodpeckers and tomtits destroy many beetles. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: H. L.

E.									TRANS 4TH INTERNAT CONGRESS ENT ITHACA NEW YORK 1928		1929		2		286-289	286	289	English						This insect occurs in Central and Southern Europe, Northern and Southwestern Africa, Asia Minor and is reported from Korea and Japan. It was first noticed in America near New York City in 1879, and has now spread along the coast chiefly northward and eastward from near Philadelphia, to the northern boundary of Massachusetts. It has been very destructive to nearly all kinds of shade trees and occasionally to apple orchards. Its life cycle requires 2 yrs. Eggs are laid in groups of 2 or more usually in crevices of bark, from May to Sept. each [male] averaging 500 eggs, which hatch in 10-15 days. The larvae tunnel in twigs, going from small twigs to larger twigs, branches or trunk; they hibernate and pupate in the burrows. Adults of both sexes have black bodies cross-banded with white hairs, and white wings marked with small metallic blue dots. Males have a wing expanse of 2 in., and [female] [female] up to 3 in. The larva reaches a maximum of 2.5 in.; it is white, pink or dull yellow, marked with black tubercles bearing hairs. The head, large cervical shield and small anal shield are dark-brown. No parasites have been recorded in the U. S. A., but woodpeckers and squirrels devour the larvae. Remedies consist of pruning off and burning the small infested twigs and killing the borers in larger galleries by injecting a volatile liquid or by inserting a wire. || ABSTRACT AUTHORS: W. E.
